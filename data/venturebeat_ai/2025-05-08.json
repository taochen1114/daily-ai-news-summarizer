The move comes as web search undergoes its most significant transformation since Google revolutionized the field more than two decades ago.\n“Developers can now augment Claude’s comprehensive knowledge with current, real-world data by enabling the web search tool when making requests to the Messages API,” Anthropic said in its announcement.\nThe new capability arrives amid signs that traditional search is losing ground to AI-powered alternatives. Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, testified today in Google’s antitrust trial that\nsearches in Safari fell last month for the first time in the browser’s 22-year history\n. “I’ve lost a lot of sleep thinking about it,” Cue said regarding potential revenue loss from Google’s estimated $20 billion payment to be Safari’s default search engine.\nWeb search is now available on our API.\nDevelopers can augment Claude's comprehensive knowledge with up-to-date data.\npic.twitter.com/pRQf0ZKXUZ\n— Anthropic (@AnthropicAI)\nMay 7, 2025\nAI assistants are eating Google’s lunch: The decline of traditional search engine dominance\nThe data points to a seismic shift in information discovery patterns.\nSOCi’s Consumer Behavior Index\nshows that 19% of consumers already use AI for search, creating the first meaningful challenge to Google’s stranglehold on web information access in decades.\nThis transformation stems from fundamental differences in how AI assistants process and present information. Unlike traditional search engines that display a list of links requiring users to sift through results, AI assistants synthesize information from multiple sources, delivering concise, contextual answers. This eliminates the cognitive load of evaluating numerous websites and extracts the precise information users seek.\nThe timing of Anthropic’s announcement is particularly significant. With Safari searches declining for the first time ever — a metric Cue called\nunprecedented\nin his testimony — we’re witnessing early indicators of a mass consumer behavior shift. Traditional search engines optimized for advertising revenue are increasingly being bypassed in favor of conversation-based interactions that prioritize information quality over commercial interests.\nUnder the hood: How Anthropic’s API transforms information retrieval for developers\nAnthropic’s technical approach represents a significant advance in how AI systems can be deployed as information gathering tools. The system employs a sophisticated decision-making layer that determines when external information would improve response quality, generating targeted search queries rather than simply passing user questions verbatim to a search backend.\nThis “\nagentic\n” capability — allowing Claude to conduct multiple progressive searches using earlier results to inform subsequent queries — enables a more thorough research process than traditional search. The implementation essentially mimics how a human researcher might explore a topic, starting with general queries and progressively refining them based on initial findings.\nFor developers, the API offers granular control through the\nmax_uses\nparameter\nthat limits how many sequential searches Claude can perform. This addresses both cost considerations and prevents the AI from falling into research rabbit holes. The domain control features provide crucial guardrails for enterprise deployments, allowing organizations to ensure information comes only from trusted sources.\nAt $10 per 1,000 searches plus standard token costs, Anthropic has positioned the feature as a premium offering, suggesting confidence that the value proposition justifies the price point compared to direct integration with free search engines.\nAI search wars heat up: Big tech scrambles to redefine digital information access\nThe competitive landscape around AI search has become increasingly crowded and contentious. OpenAI integrated\nweb search into ChatGPT\nlast fall and recently expanded with shopping features, leveraging its massive user base —\n800 million weekly active users\n, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — to challenge Google’s commercial search dominance.\nApple’s potential pivot represents perhaps the most significant threat to the status quo. With Safari accounting for\n17.25% of global browser usage\nand\n22.32% on mobile devices\naccording to the most current data from StatCounter, any move to replace Google with AI search alternatives would dramatically alter market dynamics. Apple’s discussions with\nPerplexity AI\n,\nOpenAI\n, and\nAnthropic\nsuggest the company is actively exploring multiple partnerships rather than developing its own search technology.\nMeanwhile, specialized players like Perplexity AI are making strategic moves to embed themselves directly in the hardware ecosystem. Its\npartnership with Motorola\nrepresents an early attempt to position AI search as a device-level feature rather than merely an app or website. Google’s\nreported resistance\nto this partnership, revealed during antitrust proceedings, indicates the search giant recognizes the existential threat these new models pose.\nThe court-mandated unwinding of Google’s Safari search deal — potentially\neliminating up to $20 billion\nin annual payments to Apple — may accelerate this transition by removing the financial incentive for Apple to maintain the status quo.\nContent economy disruption: Publishers face existential threat as AI bypasses traditional websites\nThe shift to AI search presents profound challenges for the content economy that has evolved around traditional search engines. When AI assistants provide direct answers synthesized from multiple sources, they dramatically reduce click-through to original content sites. This threatens the advertising-based business model that sustains much of the internet’s information ecosystem.\nGoogle Search vice president Pandu Nayak’s inability to offer “\nany guarantees\n” about traffic recovery highlights the gravity of this situation. Content creators face a future where being cited by AI may become more important than appearing in search results — yet citations alone don’t generate the advertising revenue that sustains content creation.\nThis creates a potentially unsustainable dynamic: AI systems rely on high-quality web content to generate responses, but by redirecting user attention away from source websites, they undermine the economic model that produces that content. Without a new compensation mechanism for content creators, the long-term health of the information ecosystem could be compromised.\nFor businesses, this shift demands a fundamental rethinking of digital strategy. Content optimized for traditional SEO may perform poorly in AI-mediated discovery, while content focused on providing clear, authoritative information may gain prominence even without traditional SEO markers.\nBeyond search: How AI information tools are reshaping the internet’s future\nAnthropic’s\nweb search API\nrepresents more than just another feature in the AI toolkit — it signals the evolution of internet information access toward a more integrated, conversation-based model. As search capabilities become embedded in AI assistants across applications, the distinction between searching, browsing, and asking questions continues to blur.\nThis convergence is evident in how Quora is incorporating web search into its\nPoe platform\nand how\nAdaptive.ai\nplans to use it in customer-facing applications. Rather than search existing as a separate activity, it’s becoming an ambient capability woven throughout the digital experience.\nFor everyday users, this could eventually eliminate the need to think about where to look for information — whether on Google, in a specialized app, or through an AI assistant. The cognitive load of navigating the internet’s information architecture would shift from humans to AI systems.\nThe race to redefine search has evolved into something much larger: a competition to create the primary interface through which people access digital information. With Google’s traditional search model faltering, Apple potentially pivoting away from its long-standing Google partnership, and companies like Anthropic opening their capabilities to the developer ecosystem, we’re witnessing the most significant restructuring of information access since the advent of modern search engines.\nIn this new paradigm, the winner won’t be determined by who has the best search algorithm, but by who creates the most intuitive, trusted, and capable AI interface to the world’s information. The era of typing keywords into a search box may soon be remembered as merely a transitional phase in our relationship with digital knowledge.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Companies can build AI agents tailored to their operations and maintain full sovereignty over deployment and data—without vendor lock-in.\nThe platform’s privacy architecture adheres to strict access controls and supports full audit logging, ensuring data governance for regulated industries. Enterprises also gain full control over the AI stack—from infrastructure and platform features to model-level customization and user interfaces.\nAnd given the general suspicion from some Western companies and governments around China and its growing library of powerful open source models from companies there, coupled with Mistral’s location in the European Union and the tight data protection laws it must follow (\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation aka GDPR\nand the\nEU AI Act\n), Mistral’s new Le Chat Enterprise offering could be appealing to many enterprises with stricter security and data storage policies (especially medium-to-large and legacy businesses).\nMistral is also rolling out improvements to its Le Chat Pro and Team plans, targeting individuals and small teams looking for productivity tools backed by its language models. All tiers benefit from the core capabilities introduced in Le Chat Enterprise.\nMistral Medium 3 outperforms GPT-4o and even Claude 3.7 Sonnet on key benchmarks and is available via API and on-prem\nMistral Medium 3 introduces a new performance tier in the company’s model lineup, positioned between lightweight and large-scale models. It is a proprietary model, meaning unlike previous Mistral releases, it is not available under an open source license and must be used through Mistral’s website and API or that of its partners.\nDesigned for enterprise use, the model delivers more than 90% of the benchmark performance of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, but at one-eighth the cost—$0.40 per million input tokens and $20.80 per million output tokens, compared to\nSonnet’s $3/$15 for input/output\n.\nBenchmarks show that Mistral Medium 3 is particularly strong in software development tasks. In coding tests like HumanEval and MultiPL-E, it matches or surpasses both Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI’s GPT-4o models.\nAccording to third-party human evaluations, it outperforms Llama 4 Maverick in 82% of coding scenarios and exceeds Command-A in nearly 70% of cases.\nThe model also performs competitively across languages and modalities. Compared to Llama 4 Maverick, it has higher win rates in English (67%), French (71%), Spanish (73%), and Arabic (65%), and leads in multimodal performance with notable scores in tasks like DocVQA (0.953), AI2D (0.937), and ChartQA (0.826).\nMistral Medium 3 is optimized for enterprise integration. It supports hybrid and on-premises deployment, offers custom post-training, and connects easily to business systems. According to Mistral, it’s already being used in beta by organizations in sectors such as financial services, energy, and healthcare to power domain-specific workflows and customer-facing solutions.\nMistral Medium 3 is now accessible via\nMistral’s La Plateforme API\nand\nAmazon Sagemaker\n, with support coming soon to IBM WatsonX, NVIDIA NIM, Azure AI Foundry, and Google Cloud Vertex.\nMeanwhile, Le Chat Enterprise is available in the\nGoogle Cloud Marketplace\n, and will launch shortly on Azure AI and AWS Bedrock.\nFor those ready to explore the assistant experience, Le Chat is available at\nchat.mistral.ai\n, as well as in the App Store and Google Play Store, with no credit card required to get started.\nBy combining a high-efficiency model with a customizable enterprise platform, Mistral AI is making a concerted push to lower the barriers to scalable, privacy-respecting AI adoption in the enterprise world.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

That’s our superpower. Obviously, everything starts with great shows and movies that people love. But if you think about all of the areas where Netflix has a big advantage — our reach, our recommendations, our fandom — tech enables all those things.”\nIn the coming weeks and months, Netflix members across the world will get to experience the updated TV homepage for themselves.\nKim explained, “When we first started thinking about this project, we wanted to create an experience that was more flexible for our broad entertainment offerings, more intuitive and responsive to our members’ needs, and capable of elevating the most thrilling moments on Netflix.”\nNew features\nNetflix is getting an enhanced design and AI features.\nDiscover Your Next Great Watch More Easily\n: We’re putting all the information you need to make an informed choice about what to watch front and center. That way you can better focus on what makes each title relevant for you, with callouts like “Emmy Award Winner” or “No. 1 in TV Shows.”\nMore Visible Shortcuts\n: Until now, shortcuts to Search and My List were somewhat hidden on the left-hand side. We’re moving them to the top of the page where they’re more noticeable and easier to access.\nBetter Realtime Recommendations: We’re making the recommendations on the homepage more responsive to your moods and interests in the moment.\nElevated Design\n: The new homepage has a clean and modern design that better reflects the elevated experience you’ve come to expect on Netflix.\nThe mobile experience is also getting some new features:\nA New Way to Search\n: We’re also exploring ways to bring Generative AI to our members’ discovery experience, starting with a search feature on iOS that is a small opt-in beta. This will allow members to search for shows and movies using natural, conversational phrases like “I want something funny and upbeat.”\nA New Way to Discover\n: In the coming weeks, we’ll be testing a vertical feed filled with clips of Netflix shows and movies to make discovery easy and fun. You’ll be able to tap to watch the whole show or movie immediately, add it to My List, or share with friends.\nStone wrapped up the presentation by saing, “What’s most exciting to me is how our new TV experience\ngives us the ability to evolve and innovate more easily going forward. That’s how we’re going to make the\nNetflix people know even better. And it’s how we’ll continue to connect them with even more shows, movies and games they’ll love.”\nGB Daily\nStay in the know!
