Now in beta, the platform designs user interfaces (UIs) with one prompt—and some developers\nare already gushing.\n“Google dropped the most powerful UI designer in the world,” Brendan Jowett, owner of voice AI company Inflate AI,\nposted on X\n.\nA spate of vibe coding tools\nThe use of AI in programming and development certainly isn’t new, but the concept of “vibe coding” — coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy earlier this year — is a newer concept incorporating generative AI to automate coding tasks typically done manually. This goes beyond existing AI assistants and drag-and-drop no-code and low-code tools: The focus is on the end result, not the journey there.\n“You finally give into the vibes, embrace exponentials and forget that code even exists,” Karpathy\nwrote on X\n.\nTop players in the integrated development environment (IDE) space include Windsurf (formerly Codeium), Cursor, Replit, Lovable, Bolt, Devin and Aider. Anthropic also recently launched its command-line AI agent\nClaude Code\n.\nLarger players in addition to Google are looking to stake their claim, as well: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is offering its Amazon Q Developer AI assistant as an\nadd-on for developers\nto access directly at any point in their coding; Microsoft released GitHub Copilot\nagent mode\n; OpenAI is looking to extend its capabilities in vibe coding with its Codex update and\nintended $3 billion purchase\nof Windsurf; and Agentforce is writing about\n20% of Salesforce’s code\n.\nGoogle, for its part, also recently released autonomous coding agent\nJules into beta\n.\nStitch builds UIs with a prompt\nWith Google Stitch, users can designate whether they want to build a dashboard or web or mobile app and describe what it should look like (such as color palettes or the user experience they’re going for).\nThe platform instantly generates HTML, CSS+ and templates with editable components that devs and non-devs can customize and edit (such as instructing Stitch to add a search function to the home screen). They can then add directly to apps or export to Figma.\n“Design is an iterative process, and Stitch facilitates this by allowing you to generate multiple variants of your interface,” Google Labs researchers explain. “Experiment with different layouts, components and styles to achieve the desired look and feel.”\nUsers can choose a ‘standard mode’ that runs on Gemini 2.5 Flash or switch to an ‘experimental mode’ that uses Gemini Pro and allows users to upload visual elements such as screenshots, wireframes and sketches to guide what the platform generates.\nGoogle also plans to release a feature allowing users to annotate screenshots to make changes.\nStitch is “meant for quick first drafts, wireframes and MVP-ready frontends,” Jowett notes in his X thread.\nSome say layouts are ‘unreal’; others call Bolt superior\nMany users have offered early praise.\nOne noted\n: “I tried Stitch with a ‘crypto wallet dashboard’ prompt and it nailed the layout in under 10 seconds. Unreal.”\nX user “God of Prompt”\nposted\n: “Honestly shocked this isn’t getting more attention. A real UI generator backed by Gemini with Figma export? Instant use-case.”\nHowever, others found the beta version less than optimal. Elizabeth Alli of DesignerUp outlined her experiences in a\nblog post\n: The dev prompted Stitch to make an app to help build mindfulness habits. She reported that it “missed the mark” on design elements (such as the colors she was looking for) and she wasn’t able to click around, as the platform only generated one screen (and in subsequent prompts she had difficulty generating the next logical screen or any other screen).\nAlso, there aren’t many editing options to choose from, and when Alli uploaded an image from a website she designed, she was not impressed by the formatting, typography, color combinations and “dated” shadows and icons.\n“I had much higher expectations from Google given that there are already so many existing AI to UI design generation tools on the market that do this much better,” she writes. “Their effort seems half-baked at best.”\nWhile it is in beta, it doesn’t have “anywhere near” the polished output of other offerings such as Figma’s First Draft or Uizard’s Autodesigner. “This release seems like a bit of a mad dash to throw their hat into the ring of the AI UI design hype,” Alli notes.\nOther early users agree that Stitch can be wonky and underwhelming, that the designs aren’t quite there yet, and that other existing tools are still superior.\nOne X user lamented\n: “I used the same prompt that I used to generate landing pages in other AI tools which return direct code, but the designs were so much better in the other tools such as Bolt.”\nIt’s clear Google has some kinks to work out if it intends to compete with already entrenched players. Still, it’s early in the vibe coding game, and users are eager to experiment with a variety of tools, so it’ll be interesting to see Stitch’s next iteration.\nTry Stitch out for yourself\nhere\n.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The San Francisco-based startup announced the funding round today, led by\nBase10 Partners\nwith participation from\nY Combinator\n,\nFortino\n,\nTrue Equity\n, and several angel investors. The capital injection follows Spott’s recent completion of Y Combinator’s\nWinter 2025 accelerator program\n.\n“For too long, recruitment firms have relied on outdated software to manage daily operations,” said Lander Degreve, co-founder and CEO at Spott, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “Spott solves the problem of outdated, passive, and fragmented recruitment software by offering an all-in-one AI-native platform that actively automates entire workflows, enabling recruiters to focus on what matters most and make more placements.”\nThe recruitment technology space has seen a flood of point solutions in recent years, especially since generative AI tools began proliferating in 2022. However, most of these tools address single pain points rather than reimagining the entire recruitment workflow.\nHow Spott’s all-in-one AI platform challenges recruitment tech fragmentation\nUnlike narrowly-focused AI tools that create more tech fragmentation, Spott is building a comprehensive operating system that manages everything from candidate sourcing and screening to placement. The platform already claims to have generated over 1,000 candidate reports for its customers, which include\nStanton Chase\n, a global executive search firm.\n“Existing recruitment software is largely a passive system of record, often requiring multiple integrations just to take notes, search & match candidates, run outbound campaigns or reformat CVs,” said Degreve. “As AI enters the space, the number of disconnected point solutions is only increasing. Spott brings all these capabilities, including cutting-edge AI, together in one end-to-end recruitment platform by default.”\nThe company’s approach addresses a pain point many recruitment firms face: the necessity to cobble together multiple systems to handle different aspects of their workflow — separate tools for candidate tracking, client management, email automation, resume parsing, and formatting.\nThis technical integration challenge represents a significant market opportunity. As recruitment agencies increasingly adopt AI tools, the pain of managing disconnected solutions grows more acute. Spott’s integrated approach could potentially capture significant market share if it successfully delivers on its promise of seamless workflow automation.\n“We’ve been using the report writer a lot, and the results are already very good thanks to the way the system handles the data,” Degreve cited from customer feedback. “It’s also helpful that we can review the output and make small changes with AI ourselves and instantly see how that improves the results.”\nFrom McKinsey to startup: The strategic vision behind Spott’s AI platform\nThe founders’ background brings a unique perspective to the recruitment technology space. Degreve and his co-founder Manu Vanderveeren previously worked at elite consulting firms\nMcKinsey\n,\nBCG\n, and\nBain\n, where they gained strategic insight into the recruitment industry’s challenges from a business perspective rather than just a technical one.\n“The idea for Spott emerged during our time at McKinsey and BCG, where we worked on strategy and due diligence projects for recruitment agencies focused on growth,” explained Degreve. “It became clear to us that AI would be the key growth driver and differentiator in the industry. To truly unlock AI’s full potential, the entire recruitment platform needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.”\nThis consulting background appears to have influenced Spott’s ambitious approach. Rather than creating yet another point solution, the team is pursuing what venture capitalists often call a “platform play” — a higher-risk, higher-reward strategy that aims to become the central operating system for an entire industry.\n“Building the system of record is much more complex than launching a single point solution. It requires greater effort to build and sell, as clients need to migrate to a new platform,” Degreve acknowledged. “However, we believe the only way to fully unlock AI’s potential in recruitment is to rebuild the entire system from the ground up.”\nThis strategic vision may explain why investors like\nBase10 Partners\nand\nY Combinator\nhave backed the company despite the crowded recruitment technology market — they’re betting on a comprehensive reimagining of the space rather than an incremental improvement.\nWhy AI adoption in recruitment has failed to deliver on its promise\nIndustry analysts have long identified the recruitment sector as ideal for AI transformation. With its heavy reliance on pattern matching, data processing, and repetitive communications, many recruitment tasks align perfectly with AI’s strengths. Yet the industry has been surprisingly slow to see widespread transformation from AI technologies.\nThe problem isn’t a lack of AI tools — it’s their fragmentation and failure to integrate deeply into recruiters’ existing workflows. Many recruiters report “\ntool fatigue\n” from juggling multiple AI solutions alongside their core applicant tracking systems. This complexity often negates the time savings these tools promise.\n“The most exciting AI feature in Spott is its advanced candidate and vacancy matching. By deeply understanding all your data — vacancies, AI-generated notes, emails, LinkedIn & WhatsApp messages and CVs — it can instantly surface the most relevant candidates,” Degreve said. “This boosts the value of your database and can significantly shorten time to hire, especially when combined with automated outreach.”\nWhat’s notable about Spott’s approach is that it doesn’t treat AI as an add-on feature but as the core architecture of the platform. This “AI-native” design philosophy potentially allows for deeper integration of machine learning throughout the entire recruitment process rather than just at specific touchpoints.\nEarly customer\nPauwels Solutions Group\nreports that the platform “automatically formats CVs and generates tailor-made presentations in our own template, which saves a lot of time and manual work.” With its 100% contract renewal rate to date, Spott appears to be delivering on its promises — though the sample size remains small at this early stage.\nThe future of recruitment: Agentic workflows and the changing recruiter role\nWith the new funding, Spott plans to accelerate development of what may be its most ambitious feature: “agentic workflows” — AI agents that can take over entire processes within the recruitment lifecycle with minimal human supervision.\n“Over the next 6 to 12 months, our main focus is on building intuitive agentic workflows. These AI agents will support recruiters by gradually taking over workflows like sourcing, outreach, scheduling, and presenting candidates,” Degreve explained. “Human input will be used where it matters most and will help the agents learn and improve over time.”\nThis vision represents a significant shift in how recruitment professionals might work in the future. Rather than spending hours on administrative tasks, formatting resumes, or searching databases, recruiters could potentially focus almost exclusively on relationship-building and closing placements.\n“Over the next few years, Spott envisions a major shift in recruitment that will redefine the role of the recruiter,” said Degreve. “As AI automates repetitive tasks, straightforward roles will increasingly be handled fully autonomously. In more complex searches, the recruiter’s focus will shift toward building strong relationships with candidates and clients, understanding culture fit, navigating nuanced negotiations, and addressing challenges that require human judgment.”\nThis vision aligns with broader trends in AI adoption across professional services. The most successful implementations don’t replace professionals entirely but instead elevate their work by handling routine tasks while enabling humans to focus on high-value judgment and relationship activities. For recruitment firms feeling the squeeze of tight margins and increasing competition, this proposition is particularly compelling.\nThe true test will come as Spott scales its platform and attempts to displace entrenched competitors in an industry known for its resistance to technological change. But with fresh funding and a clear vision, Spott has positioned itself as a contender to watch in the evolving recruitment technology landscape.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Additionally, Claude provides visual notes that capture key insights from each discussion, giving users an easy way to review and revisit important points.\nSeamless transitions between text and voice, plus rich media support\nOne notable feature of voice mode is the ability to switch seamlessly between text and voice interactions without losing conversation context. This flexibility supports different user preferences and use cases.\nBeyond spoken dialogue, voice mode also handles rich media interactions. Users can discuss documents, images and complex information using voice commands while Claude maintains the conversational flow. This allows for deeper engagement with content and easier access to insights.\nFor Pro Plan users and above, voice mode also integrates personal information sources—such as emails, calendar events and documents—alongside real-time web search results. This combination of data sources offers a more comprehensive and actionable conversational experience.\nWeb search for all\nIn parallel with the voice mode rollout, Anthropic has expanded access to web search by making it available to all users on free plans. This new capability enables Claude to draw on real-time internet data, offering fresher and more accurate responses to questions about breaking news, market trends and other dynamic topics.\nWeb search for free plans adds to Claude’s growing toolkit of integrations and knowledge resources, making it easier for users to get relevant answers and stay current.\nAnthropic’s broader vision\nAnthropic notes that voice technology isn’t new territory for the company.\nBeyond the speech-to-text features in Claude’s mobile apps, Anthropic also powers Amazon’s Alexa+ and Otter AI’s transcription services.\nThese experiences inform the development of the new voice mode and its potential to integrate with other parts of the user’s digital life.\nThese updates join a broader suite of enhancements to Claude, including the launch of Claude 4, integrations with Google Workspace, and expanded research capabilities.\nA push toward more versatile user interactivity\nAnthropic highlighted the ease with which users can start a voice conversation and ask Claude to summarize calendar entries or search for documents—demonstrating the platform’s expanded capabilities.\nAnthropic has also shared media assets to provide additional resources for users interested in learning more about the updates.\nWith the rollout of voice mode in beta and web search now included for free plans, Anthropic continues to broaden the functionality and accessibility of Claude’s AI services. These updates represent another step forward in making conversational AI more adaptable and relevant to users’ daily tasks.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
