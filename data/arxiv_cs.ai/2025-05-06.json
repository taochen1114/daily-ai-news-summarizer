This creates challenges in designing software architectures and task decision-making algorithms, as different contexts may require distinct task logic and architectural configurations. To address this, robotic systems can be designed as self-adaptive systems capable of adapting their task execution and software architecture at runtime based on their context.This paper introduces ROSA, a novel knowledge-based framework for RObot Self-Adaptation, which enables task-and-architecture co-adaptation (TACA) in robotic systems. ROSA achieves this by providing a knowledge model that captures all application-specific knowledge required for adaptation and by reasoning over this knowledge at runtime to determine when and how adaptation should occur. In addition to a conceptual framework, this work provides an open-source ROS 2-based reference implementation of ROSA and evaluates its feasibility and performance in an underwater robotics application. Experimental results highlight ROSA's advantages in reusability and development effort for designing self-adaptive robotic systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2505.00795v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Howard's Policy Iteration (HPI) is a classic algorithm for solving Markov Decision Problems (MDPs). HPI uses a \"greedy\" switching rule to update from any non-optimal policy to a dominating one, iterating until an optimal policy is found. Despite its introduction over 60 years ago, the best-known upper bounds on HPI's running time remain exponential in the number of states -- indeed even on the restricted class of MDPs with only deterministic transitions (DMDPs). Meanwhile, the tightest lower bound for HPI for MDPs with a constant number of actions per state is only linear. In this paper, we report a significant improvement: a subexponential upper bound for HPI on DMDPs, which is parameterised by the bit-size of the rewards, while independent of the discount factor. The same upper bound also applies to DMDPs with only two possible rewards (which may be of arbitrary size).",

Recently, the intersection of explainability and fairness has emerged as an important area to promote responsible AI systems. This paper explores how explainability methods can be leveraged to detect and interpret unfairness. We propose a pipeline that integrates local post-hoc explanation methods to derive fairness-related insights. During the pipeline design, we identify and address critical questions arising from the use of explanations as bias detectors such as the relationship between distributive and procedural fairness, the effect of removing the protected attribute, the consistency and quality of results across different explanation methods, the impact of various aggregation strategies of local explanations on group fairness evaluations, and the overall trustworthiness of explanations as bias detectors. Our results show the potential of explanation methods used for fairness while highlighting the need to carefully consider the aforementioned critical aspects.",

A crucial component in developing a reliable prediction model is collecting high-quality time series clinical events. In this work, we release such a dataset that consists of 22,588,586 Clinical Time Series events, which we term MIMIC-\\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS. Our source data are discharge summaries selected from the well-known yet unstructured MIMIC-IV-Note \\cite{Johnson2023-pg}. We then extract clinical events as short text span from the discharge summaries, along with the timestamps of these events as temporal information. The general-purpose MIMIC-IV-Note pose specific challenges for our work: it turns out that the discharge summaries are too lengthy for typical natural language models to process, and the clinical events of interest often are not accompanied with explicit timestamps. Therefore, we propose a new framework that works as follows: 1) we break each discharge summary into manageably small text chunks; 2) we apply contextual BM25 and contextual semantic search to retrieve chunks that have a high potential of containing clinical events; and 3) we carefully design prompts to teach the recently released Llama-3.1-8B \\cite{touvron2023llama} model to identify or infer temporal information of the chunks. We show that the obtained dataset is so informative and transparent that standard models fine-tuned on our dataset are achieving significant improvements in healthcare applications. In particular, the BERT model fine-tuned based on our dataset achieves 10\\% improvement in accuracy on medical question answering task, and 3\\% improvement in clinical trial matching task compared with the classic BERT.

Agentic pipelines consist of multiple LLMs working in cooperation with minimal human control. In this research paper, we present early findings from an agentic pipeline implementation of a perceptive task guidance system. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we analyze how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a common vehicle for explainability in LLMs, operates within agentic pipelines. We demonstrate that CoT reasoning alone does not lead to better outputs, nor does it offer explainability, as it tends to produce explanations without explainability, in that they do not improve the ability of end users to better understand systems or achieve their goals.",

This paper showcases a groundbreaking sensor health monitoring system designed for the automotive industry. The ingenious system leverages cutting-edge techniques to process data collected from various vehicle sensors. It compares their outputs within the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to evaluate the health of each sensor. To unravel the intricate correlations between sensor data, an extensive exploration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies was conducted. Through meticulous analysis, the most correlated sensor data were identified. These valuable insights were then utilized to provide accurate estimations of sensor values. Among the diverse learning methods examined, the combination of autoencoders for detecting sensor failures and random forest regression for estimating sensor values proved to yield the most impressive outcomes. A statistical model using the normal distribution has been developed to identify possible sensor failures proactively. By comparing the actual values of the sensors with their estimated values based on correlated sensors, faulty sensors can be detected early. When a defective sensor is detected, both the driver and the maintenance department are promptly alerted. Additionally, the system replaces the value of the faulty sensor with the estimated value obtained through analysis. This proactive approach was evaluated using data from twenty essential sensors in the Saipa's Quick vehicle's ECU, resulting in an impressive accuracy rate of 99\\%.",

In this paper, we introduce an online, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral library when novel intents arise.

Recent work on large language models (LLMs) sheds light on their planning capability in various tasks. However, it remains unclear what signals in the context influence the model performance. In this work, we explore how to improve the model planning capability through in-context learning (ICL), specifically, what signals can help select the exemplars. Through extensive experiments, we observe that commonly used problem similarity may result in false positives with drastically different plans, which can mislead the model. In response, we propose to sample and filter exemplars leveraging plan side action sequence similarity (AS). We propose GRASE-DC: a two-stage pipeline that first re-samples high AS exemplars and then curates the selected exemplars with dynamic clustering on AS to achieve a balance of relevance and diversity. Our experimental result confirms that GRASE-DC achieves significant performance improvement on various planning tasks (up to ~11-40 point absolute accuracy improvement with 27.3% fewer exemplars needed on average). With GRASE-DC* + VAL, where we iteratively apply GRASE-DC with a validator, we are able to even boost the performance by 18.9% more.   Extensive analysis validates the consistent performance improvement of GRASE-DC with various backbone LLMs and on both classical planning and natural language planning benchmarks. GRASE-DC can further boost the planning accuracy by ~24 absolute points on harder problems using simpler problems as exemplars over a random baseline. This demonstrates its ability to generalize to out-of-distribution problems.",

As verification requires significant manual effort, we formulate an Adaptive Path Removal Problem to minimize the number of steps in this iterative removal process. In our model, a wizard proposes an attack path in each step and presents it as a set of multiple-choice options to the IT admin. The IT admin then selects one edge from the proposed set to remove. This process continues until the target $t$ is disconnected from source $s$ or the number of proposed paths reaches $B$. The model aims to optimize the human effort by minimizing the expected number of interactions between the IT admin and the security wizard. We first prove that the problem is $\\mathcal{\\#P}$-hard. We then propose a set of solutions including an exact algorithm, an approximate algorithm, and several scalable heuristics. Our best heuristic, called DPR, can operate effectively on larger-scale graphs compared to the exact algorithm and consistently outperforms the approximate algorithm across all graphs.

The method is evaluated in the LLM-PySC2 environment, a representative decision-making platform that combines sufficient complexity with domain-specific knowledge requirements. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces hallucination by generating and utilizing validated knowledge, and increases decision-making performance at an extremely low cost. Meanwhile, the approach exhibits potential in out-of-distribution(OOD) tasks, robustness, and transferability, making it a cost-friendly but effective solution for decision-making problems and autonomous knowledge generation.",
