    "content": "arXiv:2505.08896v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Developing an autonomous vehicle control strategy for signalised intersections (SI) is one of the challenging tasks due to its inherently complex decision-making process. This study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI. A comprehensive reward function has been formulated with a particular focus on (i) distance headway-based efficiency reward, (ii) decision-making criteria during amber light, and (iii) asymmetric acceleration/ deceleration response, along with the traditional safety and comfort criteria. This reward function has been incorporated with two popular DRL algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft-Actor Critic (SAC), which can handle the continuous action space of acceleration/deceleration. The proposed models have been trained on the combination of real-world leader vehicle (LV) trajectories and simulated trajectories generated using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The overall performance of the proposed models has been tested using Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots and compared with the real-world trajectory data. The results show that the RL models successfully maintain lower distance headway (i.e., higher efficiency) and jerk compared to human-driven vehicles without compromising safety. Further, to assess the robustness of the proposed models, we evaluated the model performance on diverse safety-critical scenarios, in terms of car-following and traffic signal compliance. Both DDPG and SAC models successfully handled the critical scenarios, while the DDPG model showed smoother action profiles compared to the SAC model. Overall, the results confirm that DRL-based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI can help to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and comfort.",

Given Internet-scale training datasets, LMs have likely encountered much of what users might ask them to generate in some form during their training. A plethora of evaluation benchmarks have been constructed to assess model quality, response appropriateness, and reasoning capabilities. However, the human effort required for benchmark construction is limited and being rapidly outpaced by the size and scope of the models under evaluation. Additionally, having humans build a benchmark for every possible domain of interest is impractical. Therefore, we propose a methodology for automating the construction of fact-based synthetic data model evaluations grounded in document populations. This work leverages those very same LMs to evaluate domain-specific knowledge automatically, using only grounding documents (e.g., a textbook) as input. This synthetic data benchmarking approach corresponds well with human curated questions with a Spearman ranking correlation of 0.96 and a benchmark evaluation Pearson accuracy correlation of 0.79. This novel tool supports generating both multiple choice and open-ended synthetic data questions to gain diagnostic insight of LM capability. We apply this methodology to evaluate model performance on a recent relevant arXiv preprint, discovering a surprisingly strong performance from Gemma3 models.",

    "content": "arXiv:2505.08988v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) typically models the interaction between the agent and environment as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the rewards that guide the agent's behavior are always observable. However, in many real-world scenarios, rewards are not always observable, which can be modeled as a monitored Markov decision process (Mon-MDP). Prior work on Mon-MDPs have been limited to simple, tabular cases, restricting their applicability to real-world problems. This work explores Mon-MDPs using function approximation (FA) and investigates the challenges involved. We show that combining function approximation with a learned reward model enables agents to generalize from monitored states with observable rewards, to unmonitored environment states with unobservable rewards. Therefore, we demonstrate that such generalization with a reward model achieves near-optimal policies in environments formally defined as unsolvable. However, we identify a critical limitation of such function approximation, where agents incorrectly extrapolate rewards due to overgeneralization, resulting in undesirable behaviors. To mitigate overgeneralization, we propose a cautious police optimization method leveraging reward uncertainty. This work serves as a step towards bridging this gap between Mon-MDP theory and real-world applications.",

The objective is to identify effective Courses of Action that lead to mission success within preset simulations, thereby enabling the exploration of real-world defense scenarios at low cost and in a safe-to-fail setting. Applying deep Reinforcement Learning in this context poses specific challenges, such as complex flight dynamics, the exponential size of the state and action spaces in multi-agent systems, and the capability to integrate real-time control of individual units with look-ahead planning. To address these challenges, the decision-making process is split into two levels of abstraction: low-level policies control individual units, while a high-level commander policy issues macro commands aligned with the overall mission targets. This hierarchical structure facilitates the training process by exploiting policy symmetries of individual agents and by separating control from command tasks. The low-level policies are trained for individual combat control in a curriculum of increasing complexity. The high-level commander is then trained on mission targets given pre-trained control policies. The empirical validation confirms the advantages of the proposed framework.",

A technique of agentic reinforcement learning is applied, in which an LLM as a Judge (LLMaaJ) teaches another LLM, through in-context learning, how to produce content by interpreting the intended and unintended generated text traits. To measure human mental beliefs around content production, users modify long form AI-generated text articles before publication at the US Open 2024 tennis Grand Slam. Now, an LLMaaJ can solve the Theory of Mind (ToM) alignment problem by anticipating and including human edits within the creation of text from an LLM. Throughout experimentation and by interpreting the results of a live production system, the expectations of human content reviewers had 100% of alignment with AI 53.8% of the time with an average iteration count of 4.38. The geometric interpretation of content traits such as factualness, novelty, repetitiveness, and relevancy over a Hilbert vector space combines spatial volume (all trait importance) with vertices alignment (individual trait relevance) enabled the LLMaaJ to optimize on Human ToM. This resulted in an increase in content quality by extending the coverage of tennis action.

MCBS produces several candidate actions around the policy's output and assesses them through short-horizon rollouts, enabling the agent to make better-informed choices.

Additionally, we offer a detailed analysis of crucial hyperparameters, such as beam width and rollout depth, and explore adaptive strategies to optimize MCBS for complex control tasks.

We evaluate additional models, such as DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o-mini, to test whether cooperative behavior generalizes across different architectures and model sizes. Furthermore, we introduce new settings: we create a heterogeneous multi-agent environment, study a scenario using Japanese instructions, and explore an \"inverse environment\" where agents must cooperate to mitigate harmful resource distributions. Our results confirm that the benchmark can be applied to new models, scenarios, and languages, offering valuable insights into the adaptability of LLMs in complex cooperative tasks. Moreover, the experiment involving heterogeneous multi-agent systems demonstrates that high-performing models can influence lower-performing ones to adopt similar behaviors. This finding has significant implications for other agent-based applications, potentially enabling more efficient use of computational resources and contributing to the development of more effective cooperative AI systems.",
