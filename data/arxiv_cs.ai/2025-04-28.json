However, this approach often necessitates numerous iterations of computationally intensive operations, limiting its applicability in real-time scenarios. While recent research has focused on XAI hardware acceleration on FPGAs and TPU, these methods do not fully address energy efficiency in real-time settings. To address this limitation, we propose XAIedge, a novel framework that leverages approximate computing techniques into XAI algorithms, including integrated gradients, model distillation, and Shapley analysis. XAIedge translates these algorithms into approximate matrix computations and exploits the synergy between convolution, Fourier transform, and approximate computing paradigms. This approach enables efficient hardware acceleration on TPU-based edge devices, facilitating faster real-time outcome interpretations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that XAIedge achieves a $2\\times$ improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing accurate XAI hardware acceleration techniques while maintaining comparable accuracy. These results highlight the potential of XAIedge to significantly advance the deployment of explainable AI in energy-constrained real-time applications.",

Disparate data streams, from genomics and transcriptomics to chemical libraries and clinical records, hinder coherent mechanistic insight and slow progress. Meanwhile, large language models excel at reasoning and tool integration but lack the modular specialization and iterative memory required for regulated, hypothesis-driven workflows. We introduce PharmaSwarm, a unified multi-agent framework that orchestrates specialized LLM \"agents\" to propose, validate, and refine hypotheses for novel drug targets and lead compounds. Each agent accesses dedicated functionality--automated genomic and expression analysis; a curated biomedical knowledge graph; pathway enrichment and network simulation; interpretable binding affinity prediction--while a central Evaluator LLM continuously ranks proposals by biological plausibility, novelty, in silico efficacy, and safety. A shared memory layer captures validated insights and fine-tunes underlying submodels over time, yielding a self-improving system. Deployable on low-code platforms or Kubernetes-based microservices, PharmaSwarm supports literature-driven discovery, omics-guided target identification, and market-informed repurposing. We also describe a rigorous four-tier validation pipeline spanning retrospective benchmarking, independent computational assays, experimental testing, and expert user studies to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and real-world impact. By acting as an AI copilot, PharmaSwarm can accelerate translational research and deliver high-confidence hypotheses more efficiently than traditional pipelines.",

In this paper, we utilize machine learning methodologies, including differential privacy and federated learning, to develop privacy-preserving models that enable healthcare stakeholders to extract insights without compromising individual privacy. Differential privacy introduces noise to data to guarantee statistical privacy, while federated learning enables collaborative model training across decentralized datasets. We explore applying these technologies to Heart Disease Data, demonstrating how they preserve privacy while delivering valuable insights and comprehensive analysis.

However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay.

Previous studies show that integrating more medication-related knowledge improves medication representation accuracy. However, not all medications encompass multiple types of knowledge data simultaneously. For instance, some medications provide only textual descriptions without structured data. This imbalance in data availability limits the performance of existing models, a challenge we term the \"bucket effect\" in medication recommendation. Our data analysis uncovers the severity of the \"bucket effect\" in medication recommendation. To fill this gap, we introduce a cross-modal medication encoder capable of seamlessly aligning data from different modalities and propose a medication recommendation framework to integrate Multiple types of Knowledge, named MKMed. Specifically, we first pre-train a cross-modal encoder with contrastive learning on five knowledge modalities, aligning them into a unified space. Then, we combine the multi-knowledge medication representations with patient records for recommendations. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that MKMed mitigates the \"bucket effect\" in data, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation accuracy and safety.",

This paper introduces BoxMed-RL, a groundbreaking unified training framework for generating spatially verifiable and explainable radiology reports. Built on a large vision-language model, BoxMed-RL revolutionizes report generation through two integrated phases: (1) In the Pretraining Phase, we refine the model via medical concept learning, using Chain-of-Thought supervision to internalize the radiologist-like workflow, followed by spatially verifiable reinforcement, which applies reinforcement learning to align medical findings with bounding boxes. (2) In the Downstream Adapter Phase, we freeze the pretrained weights and train a downstream adapter to ensure fluent and clinically credible reports. This framework precisely mimics radiologists' workflow, compelling the model to connect high-level medical concepts with definitive anatomical evidence. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that BoxMed-RL achieves an average 7% improvement in both METEOR and ROUGE-L metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To address this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of successful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the system being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game between capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific and deception-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence, with two plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and task saturation. We validate our framework with a modified version of the game Nim and then apply it to four oversight games: \"Mafia\", \"Debate\", \"Backdoor Code\" and \"Wargames\". For each game, we find scaling laws that approximate how domain performance depends on general AI system capability (using Chatbot Arena Elo as a proxy for general capability). We then build on our findings in a theoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which trusted models oversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted models in the next step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and derive numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success. In our numerical examples, the NSO success rate is below 52% when overseeing systems that are 400 Elo points stronger than the baseline overseer, and it declines further for overseeing even stronger systems.",

Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which Al systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. This systematic approach integrates three advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for critical decisions.

Sharing such data across AV companies, academic researchers, regulators, and the public can help make all AVs safer. However, AV companies rarely share safety-critical data externally. This paper aims to pinpoint why AV companies are reluctant to share safety-critical data, with an eye on how these barriers can inform new approaches to promote sharing. We interviewed twelve AV company employees who actively work with such data in their day-to-day work. Findings suggest two key, previously unknown barriers to data sharing: (1) Datasets inherently embed salient knowledge that is key to improving AV safety and are resource-intensive. Therefore, data sharing, even within a company, is fraught with politics. (2) Interviewees believed AV safety knowledge is private knowledge that brings competitive edges to their companies, rather than public knowledge for social good. We discuss the implications of these findings for incentivizing and enabling safety-critical AV data sharing, specifically, implications for new approaches to (1) debating and stratifying public and private AV safety knowledge, (2) innovating data tools and data sharing pipelines that enable easier sharing of public AV safety data and knowledge; (3) offsetting costs of curating safety-critical data and incentivizing data sharing.",

    "summary": "這篇論文探討自駕車公司為何不願意分享事故相關資料，發現兩大障礙：一是資料中蘊含重要知識且耗費資源，內部分享也充滿政治考量；二是公司認為安全知識是競爭優勢，不是為社會福祉而公開。研究指出這些發現對於鼓勵自駕車安全資料分享有重要啟示，包括如何辯論和區分公共與私人安全知識，以及創新資料工具和分享管道，降低維護資料成本並激勵分享。",
