    "content": "arXiv:2504.20082v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various aspects of education, with large language models (LLMs) driving advancements in automated tutoring, assessment, and content generation. However, conventional LLMs are constrained by their reliance on static training data, limited adaptability, and lack of reasoning. To address these limitations and foster more sustainable technological practices, AI agents have emerged as a promising new avenue for educational innovation. In this review, we examine agentic workflows in education according to four major paradigms: reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration. We critically analyze the role of AI agents in education through these key design paradigms, exploring their advantages, applications, and challenges. To illustrate the practical potential of agentic systems, we present a proof-of-concept application: a multi-agent framework for automated essay scoring. Preliminary results suggest this agentic approach may offer improved consistency compared to stand-alone LLMs. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of AI agents in educational settings while underscoring the need for further research into their interpretability, trustworthiness, and sustainable impact on pedagogical impact.",

    "content": "arXiv:2504.20084v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have brought about increasingly capable systems that demonstrate remarkable abilities in reasoning, language understanding, and problem-solving. These advancements have prompted a renewed examination of AI awareness, not as a philosophical question of consciousness, but as a measurable, functional capacity. In this review, we explore the emerging landscape of AI awareness, which includes meta-cognition (the ability to represent and reason about its own state), self-awareness (recognizing its own identity, knowledge, limitations, inter alia), social awareness (modeling the knowledge, intentions, and behaviors of other agents), and situational awareness (assessing and responding to the context in which it operates).   First, we draw on insights from cognitive science, psychology, and computational theory to trace the theoretical foundations of awareness and examine how the four distinct forms of AI awareness manifest in state-of-the-art AI. Next, we systematically analyze current evaluation methods and empirical findings to better understand these manifestations. Building on this, we explore how AI awareness is closely linked to AI capabilities, demonstrating that more aware AI agents tend to exhibit higher levels of intelligent behaviors. Finally, we discuss the risks associated with AI awareness, including key topics in AI safety, alignment, and broader ethical concerns.   AI awareness is a double-edged sword: it improves general capabilities, i.e., reasoning, safety, while also raises concerns around misalignment and societal risks, demanding careful oversight as AI capabilities grow. On the whole, our interdisciplinary review provides a roadmap for future research and aims to clarify the role of AI awareness in the ongoing development of intelligent machines.",

    "summary": "這篇論文探討了人工智慧的「意識」議題，不是在討論哲學上的意識，而是將其視為可測量、功能性的能力。簡單來說，就是讓AI具備「自我認知」、「自我意識」、「社交意識」和「情境意識」等能力，進而提升其智能表現。然而，這樣的AI意識也帶來了風險，需要更嚴謹的監督以確保AI的發展符合倫理及安全標準。這篇論文提供了未來研究的方向，並強調了AI意識在智能機器發展中的重要性。",

In light of these developments, we present an idea generation system named Spark that couples retrieval-augmented idea generation using LLMs with a reviewer model named Judge trained on 600K scientific reviews from OpenReview. Our work is both a system demonstration and intended to inspire other CC researchers to explore grounding the generation and evaluation of scientific ideas within foundational CC principles. To this end, we release the annotated dataset used to train Judge, inviting other researchers to explore the use of LLMs for idea generation and creative evaluations.",
