As growth slowed, Wingefors had to lay off a lot of people, sell off studios or shut them down.\nRogers joined Embracer in 2022 after Embracer bought Eidos Montreal.\nWingefors will stay at Embracer and executive chairman of the board and he will be a board member of the Coffee Stain Group.\nHe said in a statement, “While the road has not always been straight, I am incredibly proud of the achievements made possible by our talented teams, which have created some incredible experiences for gamers. “This new phase allows me to focus on strategic initiatives, M&A, and capital allocation, ensuring Embracer’s continued growth and success.”\nAnd Wingefors said, “I am more convinced than ever that the best is still ahead of us. Having worked very closely with Phil over the past years, I have high confidence in his abilities. I look forward to a continued close collaboration to further strengthen the business and drive value in the coming years.”\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

But later this year, any creator using Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) will be able to make their own AI-powered characters with the same underlying technology behind Vader.\nDuring the 2025\nState of Unreal\nkeynote, Epic revealed that a new tool in UEFN called the Persona Device will allow anyone to create non-playable characters (NPCs) with AI-driven personalities. The company showed this in action with an internal demo where the player has to talk to a robot named Mr. Buttons. Epic Games executive vice president Saxs Persson said this was meant to show how the Persona Device can “enable emergent, reactive gameplay for creators and deeper experiences for players.”\nWithin the demo’s Verse code (the programming language used in UEFN), the AI prompt that defines Mr. Buttons’ personality describes it as a “mysterious cosmic entity” with infinite knowledge and curiosity, and that it must respond to the player with “comedic finesse.” Mr. Buttons appears as a floating metal sphere with a glowing eye, and it has one singular purpose: to get you to press the big red button at the center of a catwalk.\nYou don’t know what will happen if you press the button, and if you ask Mr. Buttons about it, it’ll give you vague but playful answers. If you comply with the robot’s request, the screen darkens, and the demo is immediately over. But as with the AI Darth Vader, you can try steer the conversation into other topics or even probe deeply into why it wants you to push the button so badly. It uses filler words like “ums” and “ahs” while it generates an answer to your questions.\nEpic hasn’t said whether this tech demo will be released publicly through Fortnite. But I was able to try it for myself while I was in Orlando, FL to attend the keynote and the\nUnreal Fest conference\n. I actually tried it two separate times just to see how both experiences would compare.\nIt was hard not to think about the Portal series while I played — Mr. Buttons’ personality seemed clearly inspired by the sarcastic robots in Valve’s mind-bending puzzle games. But in this case, Mr. Buttons isn’t following a script written by a team of writers, nor is its voice coming from a real actor. So its jokes and comments can never live up to the likes of GLaDOS or Wheatley from Portal.\nThat said, I was surprised with the way Mr. Buttons could tease me and remember things we discussed earlier in our conversation. In my first playthrough, I asked it to tell me about the button and why it was so important, and it responded with short stories about the button’s role through time and space. Mr. Buttons also kept promising to reward me with vast amounts of pizza if I followed its orders.\nThe second time around I tried being a little more creative. At one point, I asked Mr. Buttons about its childhood, and it said, “My childhood? Oh, darling, it was an explosion of cosmic dust and infinite possibilities! Imagine nebulas for playgrounds and supernovae for birthday candles. Quite the spectacle.”\nI also told it to only speak to me through rhymes, and later, as if it was in a Shakespeare play. “Hark, what light through yonder button breaks? It is the east, and pushing it awakes a slumbering giant for goodness sakes. Now press it ere the cosmos aches,” Mr. Buttons said.\nIt was a very superficial imitation, but it wasn’t too far off from similar prompts I’ve given to ChatGPT and other text-based generative AI tools. And it does sound funnier when you hear an AI say those things out loud with varying levels of intonation. Like with the stage demo, there were still moments of awkward pronunciations and phrases, along with some repetition (it kept prefacing its answers with “Ah, a question for the ages” to me).\nThe Persona Device tool in UEFN.\nWhat makes the Persona Device different from AI Darth Vader is that developers can use these NPCs to affect the state of the world in their UEFN games. Mr. Buttons, for example, wouldn’t let you leave the room — if you tried to open the door, you’d simply return to the catwalk and see a visibly angry robot (now with a red eye) looking back at you. But these actions have to be deliberately programmed within the game since the AI can’t generate new assets or interactions out of nothing.\nOverall, the Mr. Buttons tech demo was an amusing example of what kind of games developers can create with these AI NPCs. But I’m not sure about how long they’d be able to keep players entertained. I could’ve kept talking to Mr. Buttons as long as I wanted to, but in both of my demo sessions, I lost interest after just a few minutes. I’m curious to see how these characters hold up in a larger game filled with other objectives and mechanics.\nIt’s also hard not to think about the risks of unleashing conversational AI into these worlds, especially when\nbig intellectual property is involved\n. Despite the safeguards that Epic built in for AI Darth Vader, players were still able to trick it\ninto swearing\nand saying other problematic phrases. In response, Epic quickly issued an update that it said would prevent future incidents.\nSAG-AFTRA\n, the major union for actors,\nalso took issue\nwith the character and how it uses the voice of late actor James Earl Jones, who portrayed Darth Vader in Star Wars media (Epic trained the AI on Jones’ own voice with the blessing of his family). It’s unclear what sort of voices creators will have access to in UEFN.\nI don’t think I’d ever play a game completely focused on AI-powered NPCs, especially if it’s meant to be more story-driven. But I can see the value for smaller teams in using a tool like this to create novel experiences, or to add some variety in their games. It’ll ultimately be up to the creators to determine how useful the Persona Device will be.\nDisclosure: Epic Games paid my way to Unreal Fest.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nMistral AI\n, the French artificial intelligence startup, announced Wednesday a sweeping expansion into AI infrastructure that positions the company as Europe’s answer to American cloud computing giants, while simultaneously unveiling new reasoning models that rival OpenAI’s most advanced systems.\nThe Paris-based company revealed\nMistral Compute\n, a comprehensive AI infrastructure platform built in partnership with\nNvidia\n, designed to give European enterprises and governments an alternative to relying on U.S.-based cloud providers like\nAmazon Web Services\n,\nMicrosoft Azure\n, and\nGoogle Cloud\n. The move represents a significant strategic shift for Mistral from purely developing AI models to controlling the entire technology stack.\n“This move into AI infrastructure marks a transformative step for Mistral AI, as it allows us to address a critical vertical of the AI value chain,” said Arthur Mensch, CEO and co-founder of Mistral AI. “With this shift comes the responsibility to ensure that our solutions not only drive innovation and AI adoption, but also uphold Europe’s technological autonomy and contribute to its sustainability leadership.”\nHow Mistral built reasoning models that think in any language\nAlongside the infrastructure announcement, Mistral unveiled its\nMagistral\nseries of reasoning models — AI systems capable of step-by-step logical thinking similar to OpenAI’s\no1 model\nand China’s\nDeepSeek R1\n. But Guillaume Lample, Mistral’s chief scientist, says the company’s approach differs from competitors in crucial ways.\n“We did everything from scratch, basically because we wanted to learn the expertise we have, like, flexibility in what we do,” Lample told me in an exclusive interview. “We actually managed to be, like, a really, very efficient on the stronger online reinforcement learning pipeline.”\nUnlike competitors that often hide their reasoning processes, Mistral’s models display their full chain of thought to users — and crucially, in the user’s native language rather than defaulting to English. “Here we have like the full chain of thought which is given to the user, but in their own language, so they can actually read through it, see if it makes sense,” Lample explained.\nThe company released two versions:\nMagistral Small\n, a 24-billion parameter open-source model, and\nMagistral Medium\n, a more powerful proprietary system available through Mistral’s API.\nWhy Mistral’s AI models gained unexpected superpowers during training\nThe models demonstrated surprising capabilities that emerged during training. Most notably, Magistral Medium retained multimodal reasoning abilities — the capacity to analyze images — even though the training process focused solely on text-based mathematical and coding problems.\n“Something we realized, not exactly by mistake, but something we absolutely did not expect, is that if at the end of the reinforcement learning training, you plug back the initial vision encoder, then you suddenly, kind of out of nowhere, see the model being able to do reasoning over images,” Lample said.\nThe models also gained sophisticated function-calling abilities, automatically performing multi-step internet searches and code execution to answer complex queries. “What you will see is a model doing this, thinking, then realizing, okay, this information might be updated. Let me do like a web search,” Lample explained. “It will search on like internet, and then it will actually pass the results, and it will result over it, and it will say, maybe, maybe the answer is not in this results. Let me search again.”\nThis behavior emerged naturally without specific training. “It’s something that whether or not on things to do next, but we found that it’s actually happening kind of naturally. So it was a very nice surprise for us,” Lample noted.\nThe engineering breakthrough that makes Mistral’s training faster than competitors\nMistral’s technical team overcame significant engineering challenges to create what Lample describes as a breakthrough in training infrastructure. The company developed a system for “online reinforcement learning” that allows AI models to continuously improve while generating responses, rather than relying on pre-existing training data.\nThe key innovation involved synchronizing model updates across hundreds of graphics processing units (GPUs) in real-time. “What we did is that we found a way to just unscrew the model through GPUs. I mean, from GPU to GPU,” Lample explained. This allows the system to update model weights across different GPU clusters within seconds rather than the hours typically required.\n“There is no like open source infrastructure that will do this properly,” Lample noted. “Typically, there are a lot of like open source attempts to do this, but it’s extremely slow. Here, we focused a lot on the efficiency.”\nThe training process proved much faster and cheaper than traditional pre-training. “It was much cheaper than regular pre training. Pre training is something that would take weeks or months on other GPUs. Here, we are nowhere close to this. It was like, I depend on how many people we put on this. But it was more like, it was like, fairly less than one week,” Lample said.\nNvidia commits 18,000 chips to European AI independence\nThe\nMistral Compute\nplatform will run on 18,000 of Nvidia’s newest\nGrace Blackwell chips\n, housed initially in a data center in Essonne, France, with plans for expansion across Europe. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the partnership as crucial for European technological independence.\n“Every country should build AI for their own nation, in their nation,” Huang said at a joint announcement in Paris. “With Mistral AI, we are developing models and AI factories that serve as sovereign platforms for enterprises across Europe to scale intelligence across industries.”\nHuang projected that Europe’s AI computing capacity would increase tenfold over the next two years, with more than 20 “AI factories” planned across the continent. Several of these facilities will have more than a gigawatt of capacity, potentially ranking among the world’s largest data centers.\nThe partnership extends beyond infrastructure to include Nvidia’s work with other European AI companies and Perplexity, the search company, to develop reasoning models in various European languages where training data is often limited.\nHow Mistral plans to solve AI’s environmental and sovereignty problems\nMistral Compute\naddresses two major concerns about AI development: environmental impact and data sovereignty. The platform ensures that European customers can keep their information within EU borders and under European jurisdiction.\nThe company has partnered with France’s national agency for ecological transition and Carbone 4, a leading climate consultancy, to assess and minimize the carbon footprint of its AI models throughout their lifecycle. Mistral plans to power its data centers with decarbonized energy sources.\n“By choosing Europe for the location of our sites, we give ourselves the ability to benefit from largely decarbonized energy sources,” the company stated in its announcement.\nSpeed advantage gives Mistral’s reasoning models practical edge\nEarly testing suggests Mistral’s reasoning models deliver competitive performance while addressing a common criticism of existing systems — speed. Current reasoning models from OpenAI and others can take minutes to respond to complex queries, limiting their practical utility.\n“One of the things that people usually don’t like about this reasoning model is that even though it’s smart, sometimes it’s taking a lot of time,” Lample noted. “Here you really see the output in just a few seconds, sometimes less than five seconds, sometimes even less than this. And it changes the experience.”\nThe speed advantage could prove crucial for business adoption, where waiting minutes for AI responses creates workflow bottlenecks.\nWhat Mistral’s infrastructure bet means for global AI competition\nMistral’s move into infrastructure puts it in direct competition with technology giants that have dominated the cloud computing market.\nAmazon Web Services\n,\nMicrosoft Azure\n, and\nGoogle Cloud\ncurrently control the majority of cloud infrastructure globally, while newer players like\nCoreWeave\nhave gained ground specifically in AI workloads.\nThe company’s approach differs from competitors by offering a complete, vertically integrated solution — from hardware infrastructure to AI models to software services. This includes\nMistral AI Studio\nfor developers,\nLe Chat\nfor enterprise productivity, and\nMistral Code\nfor programming assistance.\nIndustry analysts see Mistral’s strategy as part of a broader trend toward regional AI development. “Europe urgently needs to scale up its AI infrastructure if it wants to stay competitive globally,” Huang observed, echoing concerns voiced by European policymakers.\nThe announcement comes as European governments increasingly worry about their dependence on American technology companies for critical AI infrastructure. The European Union has committed €20 billion to building AI “gigafactories” across the continent, and\nMistral’s partnership with Nvidia\ncould help accelerate those plans.\nMistral’s dual announcement of infrastructure and model capabilities signals the company’s ambition to become a comprehensive AI platform rather than just another model provider. With backing from Microsoft and other investors, the company has raised over $1 billion and continues to seek additional funding to support its expanded scope.\nBut Lample sees even bigger possibilities ahead for reasoning models. “I think when I look at the progress internally, and I think on some benchmarks, the model was getting a plus 5% accuracy every week for like, maybe like, six weeks in all,” he said. “So it it’s improving very fast on, there are many, many, I mean, ton of tons of like, you know, small ideas that you can think of that will improve the performance.”\nThe success of this European challenge to American AI dominance may ultimately depend on whether customers value sovereignty and sustainability enough to switch from established providers. For now, at least, they have a choice.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nToday, at its annual\nData + AI Summit\n,\nDatabricks\nannounced that it is open-sourcing its core declarative ETL framework as Apache Spark Declarative Pipelines, making it available to the entire Apache Spark community in an upcoming release.\nDatabricks launched the framework as\nDelta Live Tables (DLT) in 2022\nand has since\nexpanded it to\nhelp teams build and operate reliable, scalable data pipelines end-to-end. The move to open-source it reinforces the company’s commitment to open ecosystems while marking an effort to one-up rival Snowflake, which recently launched its own Openflow service for data integration—a crucial component of data engineering.\nSnowflake’s offering taps Apache NiFi to centralize any data from any source into its platform, while Databricks is making its in-house pipeline engineering technology open, allowing users to run it anywhere Apache Spark is supported — and not just on its own platform.\nDeclare pipelines, let Spark handle the rest\nTraditionally, data engineering has been associated with three main pain points: complex pipeline authoring, manual operations overhead and the need to maintain separate systems for batch and streaming workloads.\nWith Spark Declarative Pipelines, engineers describe what their pipeline should do using SQL or Python, and Apache Spark handles the execution. The framework automatically tracks dependencies between tables, manages table creation and evolution and handles operational tasks like parallel execution, checkpoints, and retries in production.\n“You declare a series of datasets and data flows, and Apache Spark figures out the right execution plan,” Michael Armbrust, distinguished software engineer at Databricks, said in an interview with VentureBeat.\nThe framework supports batch, streaming and semi-structured data, including files from object storage systems like Amazon S3, ADLS, or GCS, out of the box. Engineers simply have to define both real-time and periodic processing through a single API, with pipeline definitions validated before execution to catch issues early — no need to maintain separate systems.\n“It’s designed for the realities of modern data like change data feeds, message buses, and real-time analytics that power AI systems. If Apache Spark can process it (the data), these pipelines can handle it,” Armbrust explained. He added that the declarative approach marks the latest effort from Databricks to simplify Apache Spark.\n“First, we made distributed computing functional with RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets). Then we made query execution declarative with Spark SQL. We brought that same model to streaming with Structured Streaming and made cloud storage transactional with Delta Lake. Now, we’re taking the next leap of making end-to-end pipelines declarative,” he said.\nProven at scale\nWhile the declarative pipeline framework is set to be committed to the Spark codebase, its prowess is already known to thousands of enterprises that have used it as part of Databricks’ Lakeflow solution to handle workloads ranging from daily batch reporting to sub-second streaming applications.\nThe benefits are pretty similar across the board: you waste way less time developing pipelines or on maintenance tasks and achieve much better performance, latency, or cost, depending on what you want to optimize for.\nFinancial services company Block used the framework to cut development time by over 90%, while Navy Federal Credit Union reduced pipeline maintenance time by 99%. The Spark Structured Streaming engine, on which declarative pipelines are built, enables teams to tailor the pipelines for their specific latencies, down to real-time streaming.\n“As an engineering manager, I love the fact that my engineers can focus on what matters most to the business,” said Jian Zhou, senior engineering manager at Navy Federal Credit Union. “It’s exciting to see this level of innovation now being open-sourced, making it accessible to even more teams.”\nBrad Turnbaugh, senior data engineer at 84.51°, noted the framework has “made it easier to support both batch and streaming without stitching together separate systems” while reducing the amount of code his team needs to manage.\nDifferent approach from Snowflake\nSnowflake, one of Databricks’ biggest rivals, has also taken steps at its recent conference to address data challenges, debuting an ingestion service called Openflow. However, their approach is a tad different from that of Databricks in terms of scope.\nOpenflow, built on Apache NiFi, focuses primarily on data integration and movement into Snowflake’s platform. Users still need to clean, transform and aggregate data once it arrives in Snowflake. Spark Declarative Pipelines, on the other hand, goes beyond by going from source to usable data.\n“Spark Declarative Pipelines is built to empower users to spin up end-to-end data pipelines — focusing on the simplification of data transformation and the complex pipeline operations that underpin those transformations,” Armbrust said.\nThe open-source nature of Spark Declarative Pipelines also differentiates it from proprietary solutions. Users don’t need to be Databricks customers to leverage the technology, aligning with the company’s history of contributing major projects like Delta Lake, MLflow and Unity Catalog to the open-source community.\nAvailability timeline\nApache Spark Declarative Pipelines will be committed to the Apache Spark codebase in an upcoming release. The exact timeline, however, remains unclear.\n“We’ve been excited about the prospect of open-sourcing our declarative pipeline framework since we launched it,” Armbrust said. “Over the last 3+ years, we’ve learned a lot about the patterns that work best and fixed the ones that needed some fine-tuning. Now it’s proven and ready to thrive in the open.”\nThe open source rollout also coincides with the general availability of Databricks Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines, the commercial version of the technology that includes additional enterprise features and support.\nDatabricks Data + AI Summit\nruns from June 9 to 12, 2025\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Together, the two companies are exploring how location-based AR—powered by Niantic’s Visual Positioning System (VPS)—could unlock new ways for audiences to engage with Meow Wolf’s Universe in everyday environments.\nNiantic Spatial is based on tech built for games like Ingress and Pokemon Go, but Niantic Spatial sold off its games like Pokemon Go to\nScopely for $3.5 billion\nwhile keeping Ingress and its geospatial technology. The deal recently closed.\nMeow Wolf Grapevines art by Paul Torres.\nThe Niantic Spatial partnership launches with a closed beta activation later this year at Meow Wolf’s Convergence Station in Denver. This initial phase will test ways to connect real-world discovery with in-exhibition storytelling. If successful, the collaboration could evolve into a broader multiplayer platform that invites users to explore art, uncover storylines, solve spatial challenges, and contribute to a shared universe beyond traditional exhibition walls.\n“This partnership with Niantic Spatial can open portals to an entirely new layer of imagination,” said Vince Kadlubek, Meow Wolf chief vision officer, in a statement. “The world becomes a canvas for creative expression—a scavenger hunt for physical and digital art.”\n“Meow Wolf’s narrative universe is unlike anything else—layered, nonlinear, and emotionally resonant,” said Thomas Gewecke, COO and president at Niantic Spatial, in a statement. “It’s a perfect match for geospatial AR, where your surroundings become part of the story.”\nWhile still in development, the goal is to prototype an experience where participants can engage with Meow Wolf content across city streets, parks, and public spaces—unlocking portals, discovering monumental art, and diving into layers of hidden lore. Inside Meow Wolf exhibitions, those same interactions could carry over, offering deeper story progression and access to exclusive content.\nPossible features under exploration include:\nAR Portals Anywhere\n– Enter the Meow Wolf Universe from sidewalks, parks, or neighborhoods and reveal a layer of digital art experiences around every corner.\nQuests & Show Moments\n– Complete scavenger hunts, solve puzzles, and build status to unlock exclusive in-exhibition content and experiences.\nCommunity Worldbuilding\n– Co-create the Meow Wolf Universe by contributing art, characters, storylines, and quests for others to discover.\nThe collaboration will be officially unveiled during Niantic Spatial Chief Technology Officer Brian McClendon’s keynote at Augmented World Expo (AWE) on June 11. Following the keynote, attendees can stop by the Niantic Spatial lounge for an early look at what’s in development.\nMeow Wolf and Niantic Spatial have teamed up.\nMeow Wolf creates extraordinary, mind-bending experiences that transport millions of adventurers of all ages into breathtaking realms of imagination and wonder. Meow Wolf is committed to engaging curious seekers through the magic of discovery and play. It collaborates with hundreds of visionary artists who infuse creativity into every Meow Wolf experience.\nThe journey began with the THEA Award-winning House Of Eternal Return in Santa Fe (2016), a mystery house with hidden passages and mesmerizing art exhibits. In Las Vegas, Omega Mart (2021) presented a surreal grocery store experience. Denver’s Convergence Station (2021) appeared as a maximalist architectural marvel linking four alien worlds. Meow Wolf unveiled Webby Award-winning The Real Unreal (2023) in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Meow Wolf’s fifth and newest location Radio Tave, a community radio station that spans dimensions, opened on Halloween of 2024 in Houston.\nMeow Wolf’s next exhibition opens in Los Angeles in 2026 followed by its seventh location in New York City. As a certified B-Corporation, Meow Wolf leads in themed entertainment, innovating and celebrating human imagination. All are invited to join a journey that defies convention, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nGenerative AI adoption has surged by\n18\n7\n%\nover the past two years. But at the same time, enterprise security investments focused specifically on AI risks have grown by\nonly\n43%\n, creating a si\ngnificant gap in preparedness as AI attack surfaces rapidly expand.\nMore than\n70%\nof enterprises experienced at least one AI-related breach in the past year alone, with generative models now the primary target, according to recent\nSANS Institute\nfindings.\nState-sponsored attacks on AI infrastructure have spiked a staggering\n218%\nyear-over-year, as\nCrowdStrike’s 2025 Global Threat Report\nreveals.\nFor CISOs, security and SOC leaders, the harsh reality is apparent. Deploying new AI models at scale exponentially expands their enterprises’ attack surfaces, and CISOs speaking on condition of anonymity have told VentureBeat traditional security tactics, strategies and technologies are challenged to keep pace. The cybersecurity industry has reached a critical inflection point: securing generative AI requires more than bolt-on tools; it demands a full architectural shift\nFortunately, CrowdStrike is also offering a new solution: On June 11 at NVIDIA’s GTC Paris event, the security firm announced that it had embedded Falcon Cloud Security directly within NVIDIA’s universal LLM NIM. The integration secures over 100,000 enterprise-scale LLM deployments across NVIDIA’s hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\nCrowdStrike’s strategic response\nCrowdStrike\nCEO George Kurtz captured the urgency in a\nrecent interview with VentureBeat\n: “Security can’t be bolted on; it has to be intrinsic. A significant part of our strategy has always been to leverage security data as a key element of our core infrastructure. You can’t secure AI without data and visibility at the deepest layers.”\n“NVIDIA’s NeMo Safety provides a framework for evaluating AI risk. CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence enhances that framework by enabling security and operations teams to build guardrails around emerging AI exploit tactics – informed by what we see across trillions of daily events and real-world adversary behavior. This data advantage helps organizations assess and secure their models based on what’s actually happening in the wild,” said Daniel Bernard, Chief Business Officer, CrowdStrike, in a recent interview with VentureBeat.\nKurtz reinforced this strategic vision to\nB\na\nrron’s\n, stating clearly: “Generative AI helps us bend time. With embedded, telemetry-driven security we identify and neutralize threats at machine speed, stopping breaches probably six times faster than traditional methods.”\nBernard emphasized the significance, saying, “CrowdStrike pioneered AI-native cybersecurity, and we’re defining how AI is secured across the software development lifecycle. This latest collaboration with NVIDIA brings our leadership to the forefront of cloud-based AI, where LLMs are deployed, run, and scaled. Together, we’re giving organizations the confidence to innovate with AI, securely and at speed, from code to cloud.”\nCrowdStrike embeds Falcon Security directly into NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure\nBy embedding Falcon Cloud Security directly into NVIDIA’s LLM NIM microservices, CrowdStrike delivers runtime protection where threats actually emerge: inside the AI pipeline itself.\n“AI isn’t a standalone initiative – it’s becoming embedded across the enterprise. Unlike many cloud security vendors bolting on AI capabilities, we’ve built AI security directly into the Falcon platform. This allows us to deliver protection that’s unified across cloud, identity, and endpoint – which is critical as attackers increasingly move across domains, no longer targeting a single surface,” observes Bernard.\nBy taking an embedded approach, CrowdStrike is enabling Falcon to continuously scan containerized AI models prior to deployment, proactively uncovering vulnerabilities, poisoned datasets, misconfigurations, and unauthorized shadow AI.\nTaken together these are factors impacting nearly\n64%\nof enterprises. During runtime, Falcon leverages CrowdStrike’s telemetry-driven AI, which is trained daily on trillions of signals, to rapidly detect and neutralize sophisticated threats, including prompt injection, model tampering, and covert data exfiltration.\nBernard highlighted Falcon’s unique differentiator clearly during an interview with VentureBeat, saying, “What sets us apart is simple: we secure the entire AI lifecycle. With our integration into NVIDIA’s LLM NIM, we give customers the ability to protect models before they’re deployed and while they’re running—with runtime protection delivered through the same lightweight agent that already protects their cloud workloads, identities and endpoints.”\nBernard further clarified Falcon’s critical runtime advantage, emphasizing: “LLMs are rapidly expanding the enterprise attack surface, and the risks are already real. From prompt injection to API abuse, we’ve seen how sensitive data can leak without a traditional breach. Falcon Cloud Security is designed to address those gaps with real-time monitoring, threat intelligence, and platform-wide telemetry that enables organizations to stop attacks before they happen.”\nThe risk of ‘Shadow AI’ brings to mind the previous BYOD ‘Wild Wild West’ era of IT security\n“Shadow AI is one of the biggest—and often overlooked—risks today,” Bernard warned. Shadow AI is one of the most common – and often overlooked – risks in enterprise environments. Security teams often don’t know where models are running, who’s building them, or how they’re configured – bypassing traditional software governance entirely.\nThat lack of visibility creates real risk, especially given the sensitive data AI systems are trained on or have access to. Falcon Cloud Security uncovers this hidden activity across environments, making it visible and actionable. Once you have that visibility, you can apply policy and reduce risk. Without it, you’re flying blind,” says Bernard.\nCrowdStrike President Michael Sentonas outlined the strategic advantage clearly in a\nprevious VentureBeat interview\n, “attackers continuously fine-tune their techniques, exploiting the gaps in identity, endpoint, and telemetry coordination. Falcon’s integration directly into the AI pipeline dramatically closes these gaps, giving CISOs real-time visibility and response capabilities right where attacks occur.” ⁸\nTaking a more embedded approach to generative AI security represents a compelling new blueprint for CISOs who face the challenges of identifying and containing rapidly evolving AI threats. However, it also underscores the necessity for rigorous assessment: CISOs must verify whether embedding security directly into their infrastructure precisely aligns with their organization’s distinct architecture, risk exposure, and strategic security objectives.\nAltogether, the environment of rapid adoption of AI by users and technical decision makers in workplaces seeking efficiency gains — enticed by their own personal usage of consumer facing models such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and others — even without clear guidelines or permission from organizations, creates a “Wild Wild West” situation of multiple differing AI tools with differing risks, similar to the rapid adoption of unsecured and unapproved smartphones in the workplace during the “BYOD” era of the early 2000s and 2010s.\nYet in this case, the adoption curve of gen AI models among users is much steeper and the technology is evolving much faster, from many more players, making it even more of a security minefield.\nFrom reactive to real-time: Why embedded security matters for generative AI\nTraditional AI security tools that rely on external scans and post-deployment interventions leave enterprises vulnerable at the precise endpoints and threat surfaces when and where protection is most critical.\nCrowdStrike’s integration of Falcon Cloud Security into NVIDIA’s universal LLM NIM shifts this dynamic, embedding continuous defense directly into the AI lifecycle from development to runtime.\nBernard further explained how Falcon’s AI-SPM proactively mitigates risks before deployment: “Falcon Cloud Security AI-SPM gives security and IT teams control earlier in the process—scanning for misconfigurations, unauthorized models, and policy violations before anything goes live. It helps organizations move fast without losing visibility or oversight.”\nEmbedding Falcon directly into NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure automates compliance with emerging regulations, such as the EU AI Act, making comprehensive model safety, traceability, and auditability an intrinsic and automated part of every deployment rather than a manual, labor-intensive task.\nWhat CrowdStrike’s integration with NVIDIA means for CISOs and enterprise grade gen AI security\nGenerative AI is rapidly expanding enterprise attack surfaces, straining traditional perimeter-based security methods.\nThreats specific to generative models including prompt injection, data leakage, and model poisoning all require deeper visibility and greater precision and control. CrowdStrike’s integration with NVIDIA’s LLM infrastructure is noteworthy for its architectural approach to addressing these security gaps.\nFor CISOs, security leaders and the devops teams they serve, embedding security controls directly into the AI lifecycle offers tangible operational benefits including the following:\nIntrinsic zero-trust at scale:\nAutomated deployment of security policies eliminates manual effort, consistently enforcing zero-trust protection across every AI model.\nProactive vulnerability mitigation:\nIdentifying and neutralizing risks before runtime significantly reduces attackers’ windows of opportunity.\nContinuous runtime intelligence:\nReal-time telemetry-driven detection rapidly identifies and blocks threats such as prompt injection, model poisoning, and unauthorized data exfiltration.\nBernard underscored the operational necessity of taking a more integrative approach to generative AI security. “We’re focused on securing the models enterprises are building themselves – especially those fine-tuned on sensitive or proprietary data. These aren’t off-the-shelf risks. They require deeper visibility and stronger, bespoke controls around training, tuning, and deployment. They require deeper visibility into prompts and responses at runtime, along with stronger, tailored controls across training, tuning, and deployment. That’s where we’re investing: securing AI with AI, and helping customers stay ahead as this technology becomes foundational to how they operate,” he said.\nAs generative AI becomes not just a differentiator but a foundation of enterprise infrastructure, embedded security is no longer optional. CrowdStrike and NVIDIA’s integration doesn’t just add protection; it redefines how AI systems must be built to withstand the evolving tradecraft already in motion.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

From giving medicine to a squirming baby to battling midnight boogers, these small yet recurring tasks can feel huge and stressful. Playhouse MD was born from those very moments, designed to bring comfort, connection and just a little more ease to pediatric care. Playhouse MD seamlessly combines pediatric healthcare with the universal language of play through its doctor-designed medical devices with kid-friendly characters and playful prompts.\n“As a doctor and mom of two, I know firsthand how challenging pediatric care can be,” said Kaitlin Wiseman, cofounder and chief medical officer of Playhouse MD, in a statement. “At Playhouse MD, we’re not reinventing the science behind medical devices — we’re reimagining the care experience. By telling a story through friendly characters like narwhals, butterflies and elephants, we help turn tough healthcare moments into playful, cooperative ones. The result isn’t just more smiles; it’s a stronger connection between children and their parents and a more positive relationship with healthcare.”\nTurning their vision of doctor-designed medical devices supplemented by playful storytelling into a reality took more than innovation — it required assembling a world-class team of healthcare experts alongside a network of leading business minds and renowned play specialists. Each Playhouse MD™ medical device features a kid-friendly character design and includes the brand’s signature Playful Prompts Guide, which helps empower both kids and adults.\n“As a toymaker, I’ve always believed in the magic of a child’s imagination — it’s pure, powerful and endlessly creative,” says Sydney Wiseman, Co-Founder and Chief Play Officer of Playhouse MD™. “We saw a unique opportunity to bring that same spark into healthcare by reimagining everyday challenges through the lens of play. With our playful prompts and characters, our goal is to turn tough moments into imaginative ones and help kids feel more at ease, and give parents a little more peace of mind.”\nPlayhouse MD’s innovative approach to transforming pediatric healthcare through play has also garnered support from industry leaders in the play space.\n“My life’s work has been rooted in the belief that play is more than entertainment – it’s a vital part of how children grow, learn and understand the world around them,” said Alan Hassenfeld, former chairman and CEO of Hasbro and investor in Playhouse MD, in a statement. “That same philosophy lives in Playhouse MD with their innovative approach that brings clinical care into a child’s world with empathy, creativity and joy. By integrating play into healthcare, they’re not only easing fear; they’re building trust, confidence and lasting emotional well-being and I’m honored to partner with a team that’s so aligned with my own personal values.”\nSisters Sydney Wiseman, an award-winning toy creator, and Kaitlin Wiseman, a trusted family physician, are launching Playhouse MD.\nAvailable now at PlayhouseMD.com, the brand’s debut collection includes:\nBooger Buddy\n— A Nasal Aspirator and Nasal Bulb that allows for quick and gentle congestion relief, because when your baby can’t breathe easily, no one can rest. The Booger Buddy collection helps turn stuffy noses into manageable moments with friendly characters featuring optional soft lighting for bedtime use; suitable for all ages 0M+.\nElephant Light-Up Nasal Aspirator $20\n: adult-controlled suction nasal aspirator with a fun elephant character design for less stressful booger removal; includes 10 disposable filters.\nNarwhal Light-Up Nasal Bulb $18\n: nasal bulb for adult-controlled suctioning with a playful narwhal character to relieve nasal congestion; the removable horn tip allows for easy, thorough cleaning for no hidden mold.\nMedicine Buddy\n— Medicine Dispensers with removable pacifier attachment allows for precise and fuss-free medication delivery; suitable for all ages 0M+.\nRiley the Rocket or Bella the Butterfly $17\n: two-piece design with a pacifier attachment and curved medicine channel to bypass baby’s taste buds and help reduce spit-ups; includes one 5 mL and one 10 mL syringe\nPlayhouse MD will also be rolling out at major retailers including Amazon, Babylist and Target, making it easier than ever for families to bring home their imaginative, child-friendly care essentials.\n“When we met the Playhouse MD team, we immediately saw a rare combination of personal passion, medical credibility, and deep consumer insight,” says Alaina Hartley principal at Greycroft, in a statement. “Their vision to reimagine pediatric healthcare moments through play resonated deeply with us. This is a category overdue for innovation, and we believe Playhouse MD has the vision and capabilities to build a truly category-defining company.”\nAt Playhouse MD, the company believes a dose of play goes a long way — especially on sick days. That’s\nwhy it’s reimagining pediatric care through play, transforming some of the toughest healthcare moments in early childhood into playful, story-led experiences for modern families.\nThe mission is simple: to make healthcare moments less intimidating and a whole lot more engaging, turning chaos into calm and stress into smiles.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

The horror franchise’s ninth mainline installment is taking players back to the devastated and iconic Racoon City, this time playing as FBI agent Grace Ashcroft. It releases on February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nI got to see an off-hands theater presentation of the game at Summer Game Fest Play Days. What I saw definitely felt in line with the direction the series has taken with Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village.\nHonestly, the vibes were most aligned with RE7, at least in this demo. There was a big focus on terror, with Grace stumbling around a decrepit medical facility, looking for a means of escape in a first-person perspective.\nMultiple perspectives\nNow, let me jump to the end of Capcom’s demo right now. Because they did show us that players can select between a first of third-person camera. So if you prefer that more immersive vibe of RE7 or Village, you can go first-person. But if you’re more into the classic third-person perspective, that is an option.\nHowever, the menu does note that the game recommends the first-person camera. Again, that makes sense, since Requiem is very much still in that RE7 mold.\nWe also saw some other classic Resident Evil elements. For much of the demo, Grace was chased by a corpse-eating monster, something that looked like some kind of giant, misshapen medical patient. If you’re familiar with Mr. X from Resident Evil 2 or Lady Dimitrescu from Resident Evil Village, you get the idea here.\nFight or flight\nWhat we didn’t see much of was action. Capcom did note that while Grace has some firearm training, she is not a combat expert. That doesn’t mean that the game won’t feature action, but I’m not expecting as much shooting as we got in Resident Evil 4’s remake. I’m not sure if it’ll even have as combat focus as Resident Evil Village.\nBut that’s a bit of a question mark for now. The same goes for the game’s scope. The demo took place in a relatively small area, but I expect that Requiem will cover a lot more ground. I’m not sure if Capcom is taking Resident Evil full open world, but it’s likely we explore more of Racoon City than this one facility.\nI’m excited to learn more about Requiem in the coming months before its release next year. Capcom has done great work with Resident Evil since the soft reboot of 2017’s RE7. I’m not expecting the good (and terrifying) times to end any time soon.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

You’re kind of like a bug yourself, and you’re pitted against some much bigger ones.\nI got a demo from Cubit Studios at the Epic Games booth at the Summer Game Fest Showcase on Sunday. James McWilliams, founder of Cubit Studios and game director for Infinitesimals, and Mickaël Fourgeaud, cofounder of Cubit Studios and lead developer for Infinitesimals, walked me through it.\nWe didn’t have a lot of time, so they took me through at a speedy pace. Infinitesimals is a third-person action-adventure game where players assume the role of the leader of an elite alien squadron stranded on a mysterious planet after a catastrophic crash. The Unreal Engine 5 visuals are awesome.\nInfinitesimals are small creatures who must tiptoe around giants.\nBut on this planet, the player character is barely the size of an insect — about eight millimeters tall. And players must navigate an enormous world filled with towering terrain, giant local wildlife and deadly machines. As they search for the missing members of their team and uncover the fate of the vanished colony they were meant to join, they’ll face the relentless threat of the Hunter Gatherers, the mechanical sentinels that dominate the landscape.\n“The starting mystery is what’s happened to everyone,” said McWilliams.\nI started out experiencing the lush vegetation of the planet through the eyes of miniature hero, Captain Awkney Relinrake. He’s got a very British accent, which brings a sense of humor to the situation. In the world, seemingly familiar environments become gigantic landscapes, and they must traverse subterranean ruins, explore dense forest foliage, and fight enemies on foot or in the air with your jetpack. Players can also cover large distances quickly with the POD, their versatile combat vehicle.\nBrave adventurers might fight off against hostile fauna and the massively deadly machines in dynamic and cinematic combat. Upgrade alien weaponry and deploy strategic use of stealth to evade detection. Or you can choose to hide. The choice is up to the player. Players must come face to face with creatures like they’ve never seen before as they adapt to a world where the player is outsized but never outmatched.\nIt’s a cinematic, character-driven story. As the leader of a once-elite squadron torn apart by disaster and scattered across a hostile world, players must locate, rescue and reunite their crew to rebuild their strength and bring the fight to the hostile machines hunting them down. This is not so fun considering the humans spent about 100 years on their journey to get to the research colony.\nExplore the emotional journey of Awkney and his crew as they navigate loss and hope for a new future in a rich sci-fi story.\nCubit Studios is an indie team with a mission to design bold and entertaining experiences. They take pride in delivering rich and polished experiences that their fanbase can enjoy and immerse themselves into.\nInfinitesimals is set to launch in 2026 for PC via Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Infinitesimals is available to wishlist on each platform.\nOrigins\nCubit Studios cofounders Mickaël Fourgeaud and James McWilliams\nMcWilliams said the concept started in 2013 with concepts, animations, videos and music. But he didn’t start full time on it until 2019 and then start expanding the team with funding from the United Kingdom government. And it was 2020 that proper development began after Epic Games decided to fund the whole game.\nMcWillams said the inspiration came from his fascination with nature and the combination of macro scale and small things. He also liked sci-fi and the design of characters on the insect level.\nHands-on preview\nA lush world is pretty dangerous.\nI wasn’t so nervous at first until McWilliams told me that he recommended I hold my weapon in my hand and use the D pad to select it just so I could walk through the opening forest terrain.\n“There’s no objection in the game if you choose not to fight the animals if you don’t want to. It’s just wildlife. So you can kill it if you want, or you can just fly over it. It’s totally up to you,” McWilliams said.\nI had some trouble getting through the rocks and flora, since I was so small. The demo was on rails for the sake of speed, but I moved around in a speedy way and you can pretty much go anywhere. I had to use a scanning tool to listen for signs of life like radio waves, sensors, radar emissions and more. Soon enough, we came upon a building, and I could scan the building for its electrical system.\nMcWilliams pointed to a keypad by a hangar door. I had to watch out not only for big bugs at this point, but robotic soldiers as well with things like armor and auto turrets. I turned a few corners and got ambushed by the turrets. There were also some bugs with bulb-like heads. I had to shoot them precisely in the eyes or head, depending what it was I was shooting at.\nAs a small soldier, you are always very mobile, and you can use a jet pack to get out of trouble. You can carry a drone or a rocket pack. You can upgrade and change your armor. The guns are also customizable, with different attachments like suppressors, optics and stocks.\nIn the mission, I had to find a hatch and descend into the commander’s office. On a desk, there was a key card that I needed. I grabbed it and moved on. I opened up the communications with my team and they made their way to pick me up. But it turned out that the enemy robots arrived first. I had to shoot them out of the sky before my team showed up. I got an evac and all was good with the world.\nI liked the quality of the visuals, the story and the combat.
