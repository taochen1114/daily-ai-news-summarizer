Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the I/O edition is the company’s best coding model yet.\nBut this new preview, called Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 Thinking, is even better than the I/O edition. The stable version Google plans to release publicly is “ready for enterprise-scale capabilities.”\nThe I/O edition, or gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, was first made available to developers and enterprises in May through Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 Thinking can be accessed via the same platforms.\nPerformance metrics\nThis new version of Gemini 2.5 Pro performs even better than the first release.\nGoogle said the new version of Gemini 2.5 Pro improved by 24 points in LMArena and by 35 points in WebDevArena, where it currently tops the leaderboard. The company’s benchmark tests showed that the model outscored competitors like\nOpenAI\n’s o3, o3-mini, and o4-mini,\nAnthropic\n’s Claude 4 Opus, Grok 3 Beta from\nxAI\nand\nDeepSeek\nR1.\n“We’ve also addressed feedback from our previous 2.5 Pro releases, improving its style and structure — it can be more creative with better-formatted responses,” Google said in the blog post.\nWhat enterprises can expect\nGoogle’s continuous improvement of Gemini 2.5 Pro might be confusing for many, but Google previously framed these as a response to community feedback. Pricing for the new version is $1.25 per million tokens without caching for inputs and $10 for the output price.\nWhen the very first version of Gemini 2.5 Pro launched in March, VentureBeat’s Matt Marshall called it “\nthe smartest model you’re not using\n.” Since then, Google has\nintegrated the model\ninto many of its new applications and services, including “Deep Think,” where Gemini considers multiple hypotheses before responding.\nThe release of Gemini 2.5 Pro, and its two upgraded versions, revived Google’s place in the large language model space after competitors like DeepSeek and OpenAI diverted the industry’s attention to their reasoning models.\nIn just a few hours of announcing the updated Gemini 2.5 Pro, developers have already begun playing around with it. While many found the update to live up to Google’s promise of being faster, the jury is still out if this latest Gemini 2.5 Pro does actually perform better.\nFirst hour with \"Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05\"\nPositives:\n– It's faster\n– It produces more output\n– It has a better macro play (multi file edits, better overview)\n– Output structure is better (readable)\n– It's more concise and LESS APOLOGETIC!!\nBefore: \"You are absolutely…\n— Patrick Bade (@nishffx)\nJune 5, 2025\nyou guys cooked, really enjoying the app builder.\nmade a game and tested it out, it was using imagen to build assets on the fly ? and it's up, hosted, easy to share.

The playable experience offers an immersive obstacle course and several rewards, both digital and physical, as well as several mini-games and a VIP vault exclusively for Diamond, Gold and Platinum members. The Diamond District experience is available starting today through July 2.\nPlayers can access the Diamond District’s features by linking Google Play Point account with Roblox. The experience follows on an update that allows users to redeem Play Points for exclusive items within Roblox, and now Google Play holds an exclusive space within the platform. Play Points members can acquire digital rewards within the Diamond District’s rewards, such as headphones and gliders themed after the glittering Play diamond logo.\nJackie Titus, director of Google Play’s activations and engagement, told GamesBeat in an interview, “Building off of the success from last year, we want to continue to level-up our rewards program this year with exclusive perks and experiences that truly delight and reward our most valuable members… To build on that momentum in 2025, we set out to create something our members can enjoy all over the world that would place us directly within a vibrant gaming environment that would delight them. And as we dug deeper into the content our audience loves, Roblox quickly rose to the top.”\nIn addition to the core experience, the Diamond District also offers physical rewards for Play Points members, including a custom Google Play x Backbone One controller and a limited edition gift box. Over the next week, users have access to merch from other companies, such as Duolingo’s Duo owl plushie. Titus said of the rewards, “Rewarding our members in many ways is at the core of our program. With Roblox being a completely digital experience we knew it was special and noteworthy to create tangible collectibles that represent the world of our Diamond District.”\nTitus added, “From the beginning this experience has been meticulously crafted with our members at its very core. Our creative process began with how we can convey our commitment to be the most rewarding program, delighting our members at every turn…. Our creative process started back in January with early ideation on how our Roblox world could tie into our larger brand campaign. The process was pretty hands on from the beginning. It involved many workshops, custom backend builds, new functionality and testing sessions all the way through launch.”\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nSolidroad\n, an artificial intelligence startup that promises to solve one of customer service’s most persistent problems, has raised $6.5 million in seed funding to expand its platform that automatically trains customer service representatives and improves AI agents.\nThe Dublin-founded company, led by\nFirst Round Capital\nwith participation from\nY Combinator\n, addresses a fundamental challenge facing growing businesses: how to maintain high-quality customer experiences while controlling costs as conversation volumes explode past 10,000 interactions per month.\n“CX leaders scaling past 10,000 conversations a month are often stuck between two options: either they maintain quality and eat the cost, or cut costs and watch customer satisfaction suffer,” said Mark Hughes, co-founder and CEO of Solidroad, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “None of the traditional solutions work.”\nThe funding round, which brings Solidroad’s total capital raised to $8 million, comes as companies increasingly struggle to balance customer experience quality with operational efficiency. Traditional approaches — offshore outsourcing, legacy quality assurance tools, or fully automated AI agents — often result in deteriorating customer satisfaction scores, according to Hughes.\nHow AI analyzes every customer conversation to create personalized training simulations\nSolidroad’s platform operates as what Hughes calls “an aggregation layer” that sits atop existing customer communication channels, analyzing every interaction between companies and their customers. Unlike AI solutions that attempt to replace human agents entirely, Solidroad focuses on making both human representatives and AI systems more effective.\nThe platform automatically reviews 100% of customer conversations across multiple channels, applying AI-powered quality assurance that traditionally required manual review of just 1-3% of interactions. More critically, it transforms these insights into actionable improvements through individualized training simulations for human agents and refinement recommendations for AI systems.\n“Traditional QA has always been manual and retrospective,” Hughes explained. “Someone reviews a handful of calls or emails, applies a rubric, and tells you how you did. We had to completely rethink that approach. It wasn’t enough to just score conversations with AI — we set out to make the insights actionable.”\nThe system generates personalized training scenarios based on actual conversation patterns and identified skill gaps, creating what Hughes describes as targeted coaching at scale without adding process overhead or additional staff.\nCrypto.com cuts response times by 18% while major brands see dramatic ramp improvements\nEarly customer results suggest the approach delivers measurable improvements.\nCrypto.com\n, the cryptocurrency exchange, used Solidroad to reduce average handling time by 18% while simultaneously improving customer satisfaction scores from 87% to 90% — a 3-percentage-point increase that represents significant improvement in the customer service industry.\nMarketing automation platform\nActiveCampaign\nreported saving the equivalent of a full year of manual coaching time, which the company reinvested into higher-leverage training initiatives and faster feedback mechanisms. Customer engagement platform\nPodium\ncut new hire ramp time in half by embedding Solidroad’s AI simulations into their onboarding process.\n“Across the board, Solidroad customers are seeing 90% or higher go-live CSAT scores, faster ramp times, and a huge reduction in manual QA work,” Hughes said, citing additional results from\nPartnerHero\n, which saw a 30% improvement in agent proficiency scores.\nThe platform currently analyzes hundreds of thousands of conversations monthly for more than 50 customers, with new companies signing up weekly, according to the company.\nTwo former Intercom employees saw customer service tools failing even at successful companies\nHughes and co-founder Patrick Finlay, who serves as chief technology officer, developed their understanding of customer experience challenges during their tenure at Intercom, the customer messaging platform where they first met and collaborated.\n“Patrick was building features; I was selling them,” Hughes recalled. “We saw firsthand how important customer experience is to growth, but also how frustrating it was to work with tools that didn’t actually help CX teams do their jobs better. Even great companies were stuck duct-taping together solutions that weren’t built for them.”\nThe duo represents a growing trend of second-time founders applying artificial intelligence to enterprise operational challenges. Hughes previously founded and sold Gradguide, a career guidance platform, while Finlay co-founded Y Combinator-backed no-code startup\nMonaru\n.\nWhy Solidroad chose human augmentation over the AI replacement trend sweeping customer service\nThe customer experience software market has exploded as companies recognize the revenue impact of customer satisfaction, but many existing solutions focus on either full automation or basic analytics rather than systematic improvement of human performance.\nTraditional quality assurance tools typically require significant manual oversight and provide retrospective insights rather than proactive training. Meanwhile, fully automated AI agents, while promising cost savings, often struggle with complex or emotionally nuanced customer interactions, sometimes delivering what Hughes characterizes as “hallucinations” rather than helpful responses.\n“Unlike other AI-powered CX solutions, we don’t handle conversations ourselves,” Hughes explained. “Most AI CX tools are trying to replace humans with AI agents. We help them improve.”\nThis positioning reflects a broader industry debate about the optimal balance between human agents and artificial intelligence in customer service operations.\nFirst Round Capital’s bet signals confidence in human-AI collaboration over full automation\nFirst Round Capital’s lead investment represents a significant validation of Solidroad’s approach. The venture firm previously led early rounds for companies including\nNotion\n,\nUber\n, and other category-defining platforms, suggesting confidence in Solidroad’s potential to reshape customer experience technology.\n“We’re excited to be working with First Round which was the first institutional investor in companies like Notion, Uber, and many more,” Hughes noted in the company’s announcement. “But more importantly, they’ve backed founders who know how to build.”\nThe funding will primarily support aggressive hiring, particularly in San Francisco where the company is establishing its primary hub. Solidroad plans to relocate its Ireland-based team to the Bay Area while expanding across engineering and go-to-market functions.\n“We’re currently focused on hiring engineering and go-to-market roles,” Hughes said. “We’re looking for people who want to be at the frontier of AI and customer experience.”\nEnterprise security measures address growing concerns about AI analyzing sensitive conversations\nAs Solidroad analyzes sensitive customer conversations, the company has implemented enterprise-grade security measures including\nSOC 2 Type 2\nand\nISO27001\ncompliance. Customer data remains isolated in secure workspaces with no cross-client sharing, addressing privacy concerns that have become increasingly important as companies adopt AI-powered tools.\n“Security and privacy are core to how we operate,” Hughes emphasized. “Each customer’s data lives in a secure, isolated workspace. Nothing is ever shared between clients.”\nWhat Solidroad’s success reveals about the future of workplace AI adoption\nSolidroad’s approach reflects broader trends in artificial intelligence adoption, where companies increasingly seek augmentation rather than replacement of human capabilities. Rather than pursuing full automation, the platform enables what Hughes describes as “the right balance of humans and AI.”\n“We believe AI should handle repetitive, transactional work, and humans should take care of complex, emotional, and nuanced interactions,” Hughes said. “Solidroad helps companies understand where that line is and then helps both sides of it improve.”\nThis philosophy aligns with emerging enterprise AI strategies that emphasize human-AI collaboration rather than wholesale replacement of workers.\nThe bigger picture: Why continuous improvement may matter more than perfect automation\nSolidroad’s rapid growth and substantial funding round illuminate a critical shift in how enterprises approach artificial intelligence — one that prioritizes systematic improvement over revolutionary replacement. While much of the AI discourse focuses on dramatic automation that eliminates human roles entirely, Solidroad’s success suggests that companies may find greater value in technologies that make their existing workforce measurably better.\nThe timing is particularly significant. As the initial excitement around fully autonomous AI agents encounters the messy realities of customer service—where empathy, context, and nuanced problem-solving remain distinctly human strengths — companies are discovering that the most valuable AI applications may be those that enhance rather than eliminate human capabilities.\nHughes’s vision of making “every customer interaction” a learning opportunity represents something more profound than process optimization. It suggests a future where artificial intelligence serves as a continuous feedback loop, constantly raising the baseline of human performance rather than replacing it. This approach could prove more sustainable and ultimately more transformative than the binary choice between human or AI that has dominated much enterprise technology discourse.\nIn an era where customer experience increasingly determines business success, the companies that figure out how to systematically improve rather than simply automate may discover they’ve built something far more valuable than a cost-cutting tool — they’ve created a competitive advantage that compounds over time.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nMost people interested in generative AI likely already know that Large Language Models (LLMs) — like those behind ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini — are trained on massive datasets: trillions of words pulled from websites, books, codebases, and, increasingly, other media such as images, audio, and video. But why?\nFrom this data, LLMs develop a statistical, generalized understanding of language, its patterns, and the world — encoded in the form of billions of parameters, or “settings,” in a network of artificial neurons (which are mathematical functions that transform input data into output signals).\nBy being exposed to all this training data, LLMs learn to detect and generalize patterns that are reflected in the parameters of their neurons. For instance, the word “apple” often appears near terms related to food, fruit, or trees, and sometimes computers. The model picks up that apples can be red, green, or yellow, or even sometimes other colors if rotten or rare, are spelled “a-p-p-l-e” in English, and are edible. This statistical knowledge influences how the model responds when a user enters a prompt — shaping the output it generates based on the associations it “learned” from the training data.\nBut a big question — even among AI researchers — remains: how much of an LLM’s training data is used to build\ngeneralized\nrepresentations of concepts, and how much is instead\nmemorized\nverbatim or stored in a way that is identical or nearly identical to the original data?\nThis is important not only for better understanding how LLMs operate — and when they go wrong — but also as model providers defend themselves in copyright infringement lawsuits brought by data creators and owners, such as artists and record labels. If LLMs are shown to reproduce significant portions of their training data verbatim, courts could be more likely to side with plaintiffs arguing that the models unlawfully copied protected material. If not — if the models are found to generate outputs based on generalized patterns rather than exact replication — developers may be able to continue scraping and training on copyrighted data under existing legal defenses such as fair use.\nNow, we finally have an answer to the question of how much LLMs memorize versus generalize:\na new study released this week\nfrom researchers at Meta, Google DeepMind, Cornell University, and NVIDIA finds that\nGPT-style models have a fixed memorization capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter\n.\nTo understand what 3.6 bits means in practice:\nA single bit is the smallest unit of digital data, representing either a 0 or a 1. Eight bits make up one byte.\nStoring 3.6 bits allows for approximately 12.13 distinct values, as calculated by 2^3.6.\nThis is about the amount of information needed to choose one of 12 options—similar to selecting a month of the year or the outcome of a roll of a 12-sided die.\nIt\nis not enough to store even one English letter (which needs about 4.7 bits),\nbut it is just enough to encode a character from a reduced set of 10 common English letters (which requires about 3.32 bits).\nIn bytes, 3.6 bits is 0.45 bytes—less than half the size of a typical character stored in ASCII (which uses 8 bits or 1 byte).\nThis number is model-independent within reasonable architectural variations: different depths, widths, and precisions produced similar results. The estimate held steady across model sizes and even precision levels, with full-precision models reaching slightly higher values (up to 3.83 bits/parameter).\nMore training data DOES NOT lead to more memorization — in fact, a model will be\nless likely\nto memorize any single data point\nOne key takeaway from the research is that models do not memorize more when trained on more data. Instead, a model’s fixed capacity is distributed across the dataset, meaning each individual datapoint receives less attention.\nJack Morris, the lead author,\nexplained via the social network X\nthat “training on more data will force models to memorize less per-sample.”\nThese findings may help ease concerns around large models memorizing copyrighted or sensitive content.\nIf memorization is limited and diluted across many examples, the likelihood of reproducing any one specific training example decreases. In essence, more training data leads to safer generalization behavior, not increased risk.\nHow the researchers identified these findings\nTo precisely quantify how much language models memorize, the researchers used an unconventional but powerful approach:\nthey trained transformer models on datasets composed of uniformly random bitstrings\n. Each of these bitstrings was sampled independently, ensuring that no patterns, structure, or redundancy existed across examples.\nBecause each sample is unique and devoid of shared features, any ability the model shows in\nreconstructing or identifying these strings during evaluation directly reflects how much information it retained—or memorized\n—during training.\nThe key reason for this setup was to completely eliminate the possibility of generalization. Unlike natural language—which is full of grammatical structure, semantic overlap, and repeating concepts—uniform random data contains no such information. Every example is essentially noise, with no statistical relationship to any other. In such a scenario, any performance by the model on test data must come purely from memorization of the training examples, since there is no distributional pattern to generalize from.\nThe authors argue their method is perhaps\none of the only principled ways to decouple memorization from learning\nin practice, because when LLMs are trained on real language, even when they produce an output that matches the training data, it’s difficult to know whether they memorized the input or merely inferred the underlying structure from the patterns they’ve observed.\nThis method allows the researchers to map a direct relationship between the number of model parameters and the total information stored. By gradually increasing model size and training each variant to saturation, across hundreds of experiments on models ranging from 500K to 1.5 billion parameters, they observed consistent results:\n3.6 bits memorized per parameter\n, which they report as a fundamental measure of LLM memory capacity.\nThe team applied their methodology to models trained on real-world datasets as well. When trained on text, models exhibited a balance of memorization and generalization.\nSmaller datasets encouraged more memorization, but as dataset size increased, models shifted toward learning generalizable patterns. This transition was marked by a phenomenon known as “double descent,” where performance temporarily dips before improving once generalization kicks in.\nThe study also examined how model precision—comparing training in bfloat16 versus float32—affects memorization capacity. They observed a modest increase from 3.51 to 3.83 bits-per-parameter when switching to full 32-bit precision. However, this gain is far less than the doubling of available bits would suggest, implying diminishing returns from higher precision.\nUnique data is more likely to be memorized\nThe paper proposes a scaling law that relates a model’s capacity and dataset size to the effectiveness of membership inference attacks.\nThese attacks attempt to determine whether a particular data point was part of a model’s training set. The research shows that such attacks become unreliable as dataset size grows, supporting the argument that large-scale training helps reduce privacy risk.\nWhile the paper focuses on average-case behavior, some researchers have pointed out that certain types of data—such as highly unique or stylized writing—may still be more susceptible to memorization.\nThe authors acknowledge this limitation and emphasize that their method is designed to characterize general trends rather than edge cases.\nMoving toward greater human understanding of LLM understanding\nBy introducing a principled and quantifiable definition of memorization, the study gives developers and researchers new tools for evaluating the behavior of language models. This helps not only with model transparency but also with compliance, privacy, and ethical standards in AI development. The findings suggest that more data—and not less—may be the safer path when training large-scale language models.\nTo put total model memorization in perspective:\nA 500K-parameter model can memorize roughly 1.8 million bits, or 225 KB of data.\nA 1.5 billion parameter model can hold about 5.4 billion bits, or 675 megabytes of raw information.\nThis is not comparable to typical file storage like images (e.g., a 3.6 MB uncompressed image is about 30 million bits), but it is significant when distributed across discrete textual patterns.\nI’m no lawyer or legal expert, but I would highly expect such research to be cited in the numerous ongoing lawsuits between AI providers and data creators/rights owners.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nCISOs know precisely where their AI nightmare unfolds fastest. It’s inference, the vulnerable stage where live models meet real-world data, leaving enterprises exposed to prompt injection, data leaks, and model jailbreaks.\nDatabricks Ventures\nand\nNoma Security\nare confronting these inference-stage threats head-on. Backed by a fresh $32 million Series A round led by Ballistic Ventures and Glilot Capital, with strong support from Databricks Ventures, the partnership aims to address the critical security gaps that have hindered enterprise AI deployments.\n“The number one reason enterprises hesitate to deploy AI at scale fully is security,” said Niv Braun, CEO of Noma Security, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “With Databricks, we’re embedding real-time threat analytics, advanced inference-layer protections, and proactive AI red teaming directly into enterprise workflows. Our joint approach enables organizations to accelerate their AI ambitions safely and confidently finally,” Braun said.\nSecuring AI inference demands real-time analytics and runtime defense, Gartner finds\nTraditional cybersecurity prioritizes perimeter defenses, leaving AI inference vulnerabilities dangerously overlooked. Andrew Ferguson, Vice President at Databricks Ventures, highlighted this critical security gap in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, emphasizing customer urgency regarding inference-layer security. “Our customers clearly indicated that securing AI inference in real-time is crucial, and Noma uniquely delivers that capability,” Ferguson said. “Noma directly addresses the inference security gap with continuous monitoring and precise runtime controls.”\nBraun expanded on this critical need. “We built our runtime protection specifically for increasingly complex AI interactions,” Braun explained. “Real-time threat analytics at the inference stage ensure enterprises maintain robust runtime defenses, minimizing unauthorized data exposure and adversarial model manipulation.”\nGartner’s recent analysis confirms that enterprise demand for advanced AI\nTrust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM)\ncapabilities is surging. Gartner predicts that through 2026, over\n80%\nof unauthorized AI incidents will result from internal misuse rather than external threats, reinforcing the urgency for integrated governance and real-time AI security.\nGartner’s AI TRiSM framework illustrates comprehensive security layers essential for managing enterprise AI risk effectively. Source: Gartner\nNoma’s proactive red teaming aims to ensure AI integrity from the outset\nNoma’s proactive red teaming approach is strategically central to identifying vulnerabilities long before AI models reach production, Braun told VentureBeat. By simulating sophisticated adversarial attacks during pre-production testing, Noma exposes and addresses risks early, significantly enhancing the robustness of runtime protection.\nDuring his interview with VentureBeat, Braun elaborated on the strategic value of proactive red teaming: “Red teaming is essential. We proactively uncover vulnerabilities pre-production, ensuring AI integrity from day one.”\n(Louis will be leading a roundtable about red teaming at VB Transform June 24 and 25,\nregister today\n.)\n“Reducing time to production without compromising security requires avoiding over-engineering. We design testing methodologies that directly inform runtime protections, helping enterprises move securely and efficiently from testing to deployment”, Braun advised.\nBraun elaborated further on the complexity of modern AI interactions and the depth required in proactive red teaming methods. He stressed that this process must evolve alongside increasingly sophisticated AI models, particularly those of the generative type: “Our runtime protection was specifically built to handle increasingly complex AI interactions,” Braun explained. “Each detector we employ integrates multiple security layers, including advanced NLP models and language-modeling capabilities, ensuring we provide comprehensive security at every inference step.”\nThe red team exercises not only validate the models but also strengthen enterprise confidence in deploying advanced AI systems safely at scale, directly aligning with the expectations of leading enterprise Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs).\nHow Databricks and Noma Block Critical AI Inference Threats\nSecuring AI inference from emerging threats has become a top priority for CISOs as enterprises scale their AI model pipelines. “The number one reason enterprises hesitate to deploy AI at scale fully is security,” emphasized Braun. Ferguson echoed this urgency, noting, “Our customers have clearly indicated securing AI inference in real-time is critical, and Noma uniquely delivers on that need.”\nTogether, Databricks and Noma offer integrated, real-time protection against sophisticated threats, including prompt injection, data leaks, and model jailbreaks, while aligning closely with standards such as Databricks’ DASF 2.0 and OWASP guidelines for robust governance and compliance.\nThe table below summarizes key AI inference threats and how the Databricks-Noma partnership mitigates them:\nThreat Vector\nDescription\nPotential Impact\nNoma-Databricks Mitigation\nPrompt Injection\nMalicious inputs are overriding model instructions.\nUnauthorized data exposure and harmful content generation.\nPrompt scanning with multilayered detectors (Noma); Input validation via DASF 2.0 (Databricks).\nSensitive Data Leakage\nAccidental exposure of confidential data.\nCompliance breaches, loss of intellectual property.\nReal-time sensitive data detection and masking (Noma); Unity Catalog governance and encryption (Databricks).\nModel Jailbreaking\nBypassing embedded safety mechanisms in AI models.\nGeneration of inappropriate or malicious outputs.\nRuntime jailbreak detection and enforcement (Noma); MLflow model governance (Databricks).\nAgent Tool Exploitation\nMisuse of integrated AI agent functionalities.\nUnauthorized system access and privilege escalation.\nReal-time monitoring of agent interactions (Noma); Controlled deployment environments (Databricks).\nAgent Memory Poisoning\nInjection of false data into persistent agent memory.\nCompromised decision-making, misinformation.\nAI-SPM integrity checks and memory security (Noma); Delta Lake data versioning (Databricks).\nIndirect Prompt Injection\nEmbedding malicious instructions in trusted inputs.\nAgent hijacking, unauthorized task execution.\nReal-time input scanning for malicious patterns (Noma); Secure data ingestion pipelines (Databricks).\nHow Databricks Lakehouse architecture supports AI governance and security\nDatabricks’ Lakehouse architecture combines traditional data warehouses’ structured governance capabilities with data lakes’ scalability, centralizing analytics, machine learning and AI workloads within a single, governed environment.\nBy embedding governance directly into the data lifecycle, Lakehouse architecture addresses compliance and security risks, particularly during the inference and runtime stages. It aligns closely with industry frameworks such as OWASP and MITRE ATLAS.\nDuring our interview, Braun highlighted the platform’s alignment with the stringent regulatory demands he’s seeing in sales cycles and with existing customers. “We automatically map our security controls onto widely adopted frameworks like OWASP and MITRE ATLAS. This allows our customers to comply confidently with critical regulations such as the EU AI Act and ISO 42001. Governance isn’t just about checking boxes. It’s about embedding transparency and compliance directly into operational workflows.”\nDatabricks Lakehouse integrates governance and analytics to securely manage AI workloads. Source: Gartner\nHow Databricks and Noma plan to secure enterprise AI at scale\nEnterprise AI adoption is accelerating, but as deployments expand, so do security risks, especially at the model inference stage.\nThe partnership between Databricks and Noma Security addresses this directly by providing integrated governance and real-time threat detection, with a focus on securing AI workflows from development through production.\nFerguson explained the rationale behind this combined approach clearly: “Enterprise AI requires comprehensive security at every stage, especially at runtime. Our partnership with Noma integrates proactive threat analytics directly into AI operations, giving enterprises the security coverage they need to scale their AI deployments confidently.”\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

An estimated 100 million-plus players have participated in Dots.eco planet saving activities. And this week, Supercell, Zynga and Rovio are all turning on their integrations related to environmental themes.\nThrough the real world rewards program, players can plant trees, protect wildlife, clean oceans, and more, just by reaching milestones, purchasing game items, making website purchases, or completing game missions. The game becomes the conduit for doing good, said Nadav Grosz, CEO of Dots.eco, in an interview with GamesBeat.\nDots.eco is a partner in The Playing for the Planet Alliance, an initiative facilitated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Today, the program is kicking off today with 57 studios participating in its annual\nGreen Game Jam\nwith the project’s official Go-Live date.\n“We thought: What if every game could offer impact this way?” said Grosz. “When our pilot with Playtika’s House of Fun showed record-breaking results, we knew this had to become a platform.”\nBelka Games’ Clockmaker\nHay Day is Supercell’s farming-centered casual title that empowers players to protect nature. For the Green Game Jam 2025, Hay Day is spotlighting pollinator habitat protection through a campaign supporting conservation organisations via Dots.eco and On the Edge Conservation, turning player engagement into real-world conservation results.\nIn Wooga’s June’s Journey, players are rewarded with animal- and plant-inspired decorations as part of the event, while behind the scenes, Dots.eco is enabling real conservation action on the ground.\nAnd in Social Point’s Dragon City, players can join the Environment Day Pass to help plant real trees through Dots.eco. They’ll receive a personalized certificate showing their real-world impact by completing missions and unlocking the Environment Day Monument or the Spiked Leatherback Dragon.\nOrigins\nZimad’s Magic Jigsaw Puzzles.\nDots.eco was founded by university friends Grosz, a tech-savvy serial entrepreneur, and long time environmental activist, and Daniel Madrid Spitz, who has extensive background in operations and sales, as a pivot from a positive-impact gaming studio named Ethical Wizards.\n“We started seeing traction with one of our games and already thought about offering our impact stack as an SDK so that other games can use it. I wasn’t so sure about the results of the game, and wanted to consult with my friend Tal Friedman, who at the time, was the GM of Playtika’s House of Fun,” said Grosz. “When he opened our analytics, the results of our game were so good, that he immediately offered that we’ll run a test with House of Fun. The players loved it, and the results were above any expectation. We were shocked, and this is how Dots.eco was born.”\nWith very little funding to date, they have managed to sign contracts and integrate into some of the biggest games and studios in the industry, build deep technology and generate massive impact.\nFounded with a mission to save the planet and to engage players in their games, the business is going well so far. Over 3 million players won a Dots.eco certificate and made an impact that contributed to a cause. They planted 1,400,00 trees, saved 800,000 sea turtles’ hatchlings, protected 7 million acres of wildlife habitat, cleaned 400 tons of ocean plastic, restored over 30,000 corals, and more.\nThe best performing campaigns boosted total revenues by 10%, increased first time paying users by 20%, increased gameplay by 25%. Pretty good for a company with just 13 people and about $1 million raised to date.\n“We’re a service that was started after I had a gaming studio. This was called the Ethical Wizards, in which I created sustainable games. And I saw the need for a deeper solution, technical solution, and trusted solution for adding environmental impact in a way that is traceable, reliable, trackable, transparent into games,” said Grosz.\nThey came up with a wide variety of missions where gamers could do good, like planting trees, and realized there were ways to verify that the trees were getting planted through satellite images and AI.\n“We get images, videos, everything we upload to our platform, and analyze everything, check different measurements of progress, how the project progressing, if it’s satisfying, if it’s delivering according to the promise or not. And all of those projects, we convert them into quantifiable micro units,” Grosz said. “We call it dots. Those are the dots, and these are used in games to motivate players to perform actions, to progress in the game levels, to place in app purchases, remove ads, and more.”\nThey send out certificates and 18% of players who get them share it. That becomes a path to virality for the game, boosting a game’s popularity and social awareness.\n“That helps the game get return visitors,” Grosz said. “We have attention and other parameters, and it shows that we can increase gameplay 25% for the first-time paying users. These activities can fit any game. Our momentum is strong.”\n“We humbly believe that we might have the formula here to do real, transformative change, because donation and charity, it’s nice people feel good about it,” said Madrid Spitz, in an interview with GamesBeat.”To make real change in this whole transformative change, we really need to harness the businesses, the system that we live in. So I found that as the most exciting part of what we do, showing that this is our positive growing KPIs, businesses understand what is there.”\nHow it works\nSciplay’s Bingo Showdown\nThe Dots.eco platform exposes an API to over 250 vetted global environmental projects that are constantly monitored, including by satellite imagery analysis, images from the grounds, and reports, analysed by inhouse AI technology.\nDots.eco can integrate naturally with many game themes, as it supports a wide range of animal species, habitats and subjects that are present in almost every game.\nGames integrate the API, or the Dots.eco Unity SDK, and incentivise in-game milestones, or In-App-Purchases. For example, you will save a sea-turtle, or buy 10ft2 of land for wildlife, protect your game hero animal, for downloading the game, reaching a certain level, buying a skin or removing ads.\nWith very little funding to date, they have managed to sign contracts and integrate into some of the biggest games and studios in the industry, build deep technology and generate massive impact.\nBackground\nDots.eco is a platform for environmental rewards that transforms millions of micro-casual actions into real-life environmental impact. The company can celebrate each individual who takes positive action for their company, their life, and the planet.\nBy integrating into games and other apps, the company is building the world’s largest community of impact makers and collectors and are dedicated to converting daily actions into transformative impact for a sustainable future.\nAs a B-Corp certified company (a company working for public benefit), official partners of the UN Decade for Ecosystem Restoration, part of Google Startups for Sustainable Development and a nominee for the Earthshot Prize, the company is committed to making a real difference.\nDots.eco believes that environmental impact can be closely aligned with business growth, and that it has the formula to make a truly transformative change on the planet. Dots.eco’s goal for 2025 is to increase its impact by 10 times from 2024 and build the world’s largest community of impact makers and collectors.\n“We’re incredibly proud of the scale of our impact so far, but even more so of the environmental awareness it’s building in the global gaming community. We believe gaming can make a transformative change on the planet. And we’re working toward a future where 5 million Dots isn’t a milestone, it’s a monthly, weekly or daily norm,” said Grosz.\nDots.eco’s activities span beyond gaming, and it has already partnered with some of the leading companies out there, whether through their loyalty programs, employee benefit programs or direct integration into their products, from media buying, travel, to insurance and even electric car rental. One of our main goals is to create the world’s largest community of impact collectors, and to expose more people to sustainable gaming experience, providing more value to our partners.\nWorld Environment Day – June 5\nBoombox’s Triple Match 3\nThis week, the company and other groups going live with in-game environmental activations across several top studios and genres, timed to celebrate World Environment Day. These activations allow players to contribute to real-world impact, like planting trees or protecting wildlife, through regular gameplay.\nParticipating titles include Angry Birds Dream Blast (Rovio), Dragon City (Social Point), Hay Day (Supercell), Best Fiends (Playtika) and June’s Journey (Wooga). They all started on June 4.\nPlayers will be able to contribute to real-world restoration projects by progressing through storylines, completing missions, or making purchases, all seamlessly integrated into each game’s theme and mechanics.\n“It was a great pleasure to collaborate with Dots.eco for the June’s Journey Wildlife Week campaign. We aimed to make this campaign more prominent and exciting for our players compared with previous years, and Dots.eco provided fantastic support to achieve this goal,” said Galina Fedulova, Lead product marketing manager at Wooga.\nThese are not just good for the planet – they’re good for business. Past campaigns using Dots.eco’s platform have boosted revenues by over 10%, increased first-time payers by 20%, and increased session time by 25%, all while earning the highest sentiment scores some studios have seen\n“We partnered with Dots.eco for our Earth Week Community Event in Triple Match 3D. This collaboration was a huge success, significantly boosting our game’s KPIs and positively impacting our social channels.

By combining neural networks and physics, it enables characters to move and respond dynamically, in real time, said Jorge del Val, co-founder and CEO of Latent Technology, in an interview with GamesBeat.\nLatent Technology founders Jack Harmer (left) and Jorge del Val.\n“We’re creating the engine that will enable developers based on a foundation model, but it’s a foundation model for the kind of technology that we are doing, which we call a generative physics animation,” del Val said. “It’s not the same foundation model as an LLM. We are calling it Phoenix, and it will be the most advanced foundation model when it comes out.”\nAlbionVC and Spark Capital co-led the round, which also saw participation from Root Ventures and Alumni Ventures, marks a significant milestone as the company prepares to scale its breakthrough animation technology.\nLatent said the challenge of doing physics right is becoming more urgent as game development costs\nrise sharply\n. Budgets for triple-A games have increased significantly, with projections indicating an 8% CAGR through 2028, outpacing revenue growth and putting pressure on studios to deliver high-quality, cost-efficient games.\nLatent’s technology is built on Phoenix, the company’s proprietary generative physics animation model currently under development. Unlike manually crafted or pre-rendered animations, the system enables autonomous behaviors that respond to the environment in real time.\nLatent Technology is generating physics for games in real time.\n“I’ve never been a big fan of incremental innovation when you make the same thing a bit cheaper or more efficient. I’ve always liked more the things that give you fundamentally different experiences,” said del Val.\nThis creates a new foundation for interactive experiences, where characters and environments react dynamically to player input and evolving gameplay conditions instead of following pre-scripted sequences.\n“AI gives us the opportunity to transform not only how developers create games, but also how players experience them,” said del Val. “While many companies are using AI to optimize existing workflows, we’re focused on enabling something fundamentally new – emergent, interactive animation that reacts in real time. Our aim is to evolve the animation paradigm towards emergent physical behaviors, opening up new, creative possibilities for developers and dynamic experiences for players.”\nThe new investment will support the continued development of Latent’s technology, particularly the Latent Behaviour Engine. This product is designed to enable developers to seamlessly define and deploy emergent behaviors based on generative physics in their games. Latent is currently running a closed beta with select studios and plans to release two additional tech demos later this year to showcase the technology in action and further refine its tools.\nDel Val said, “Our technology allows us to prototype rapidly while delivering experiences that were not possible before. We aim to stay close to the development workflow by shipping real, playable demos that showcase our technology in action.”\nSebastian Hunte, an investor AlbionVC, said in a statement: “Latent’s technology positions it to become core infrastructure for the future of game development—powering next-gen interactive experiences through real-time, generative animation. Just as LLMs have revolutionized content creation, Latent is laying the foundation for a similar leap in animation. With strong early traction and a deeply technical team, we’re thrilled to support their journey.”\nLatent Technology was named as a\nGame Changer\nlast year at GamesBeat Next 2024.\n“The past two years has been about implementing the technology and proving that it works in a real setting, for example, in a game engine,” said del Val. “We made a proof of concept, and we proved that it worked. Now we need to scale the technology and create a product to enable developers to create emergent physical behaviors. This new round will fund that effort.”\nDel Val said a few design partners have tried out the technology. The company will provide authoring capabilities so developers can create anything that want.\n“The idea is that anybody could, instead of crafting pre-baked animations, with just a few directives, craft an actual emergent physical behavior that then they can deploy instantly to the game and play with it directly,” del Val said. “All of the process and a huge barrier would be eliminated, but the result would be an experience which is emergent, which also offers new possibilities for actual players, for them to feel something different when they’re interacting with characters in real time, as if they’re alive.”\nThe team has six people, and del Val hopes to double the number by the end of the year. The money will go toward tech and product development. The team is working on a hybrid remote model.\n“We are a very lean team, and I’m proud to say that every hire for us is a key hire,” del Val said. “We have a prototyping team as well, constantly dogfooding the technology. We have a few prototypes in the works that we plan to ship. Those will be more like tech demos rather than actual games, whose purpose is to showcase the technology.”\nWith the tech, game developers will enable objects and characters to interact in real time, where there are no pre-baked animations.\n“We are achieving very lifelike and natural interactions, and we want to take this to the next level,” del Val said. “By default, the characters created with the behavior engine will be fully interactive and and natural looking, and you will be able to interact with them. All of this is enabled by by our foundation model.”\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

Bennahum, Scott Rupp, and Davidi Gilo had sued to stop the issuance of Ready Gibraltar’s\nPLAY\n’s tokens and related assets.\nIn April, the Supreme Court of Gibraltar overturned a worldwide freeze on 542 million $PLAY tokens, finding their claim had “no real prospect of success” and calling it “oppressive.” Later that month, the court ordered the claimants to pay approximately $550,000 in indemnity costs to Play Network for misleading the court, including an immediate interim payment of approximately $300,000.\nIn June 3rd´s written judgement, the Court of Appeal for Gibraltar upheld the findings, ruling that  the February 4 freeze was a “miscarriage of justice” and that “the claimants have no real prospect of success” to challenge the freeze reversal.\nBennahum, in a statement, said, “Litigation between Ready Makers Inc. and Ms. Macedo in Gibraltar remains very much ongoing. While the Court of Appeal recently lifted the temporary freeze of the tokens and we were ordered to pay costs related to those preliminary hearings, these are procedural matters that do not determine the underlying dispute. The core claim—seeking a declaration that Ready Makers Inc. is the beneficial owner of Ready Maker (Gibraltar) Ltd.—is still before the court. We therefore disagree with any suggestion that Ms. Macedo has ‘prevailed’ on the substantive issues and remain confident in our position. As the proceedings are active, we will not comment further at this time.”\nThe judgement noted that the claimants’ “groundless and damaging interlocutory onslaught on the operation of Ready Gibraltar’s business must have raised serious doubts in the relevant business world about its soundness,” according to Play Network. Play Network said the court said that Bitkraft and the trio (Bennahum, Rupp, and Gilo) now “have a good deal to answer for.”\nReady US’ claim to Ready Gibraltar was “unsupported by so much as a single piece of paper.” The Court of Appeal ruled “the claimants had and have no arguable claim to a proprietary interest in, or entitlement to, any of the tokens forming part of Ready Gibraltar’s assets\n.\n”\nThe claimants allegedly withheld documents “adverse to their case”, hiding that Ready US was dissolved in 2024 and portraying it as a “thriving company,” Play Network said. And the “wrongly granted” February freeze inflicted “massive, and continuing, damage on the value of the Ready Gibraltar tokens,” resulting in “driving the business into the ground,” the court said.\nThe court noted that the injunctions the trio obtained were “destined to kill the golden goose.” For Macedo, the episode shows how seasoned, well-funded male investors tried to dilute the equity of a female founder, Play Network said.\nPlay characters.\nPlay Network’s successful legal defense was led by London-based attorney James Ramsden KC (Astraea Group), known for defending crypto startups. Ramsden was supported by Philippe Kuhn (39 Essex Chambers), Signature Litigation, and Bull Blockchain Law.\n“This unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal follows the emphatic judgment of Mr Justice Restano on 5th April 2025. The court has found that any challenge to that judgment has “no reasonable prospect of success” and has confirmed the discharge of the worldwide freezing order and trust preservation order over the $PLAY tokens and shares of Ready Gibraltar granted on February 4, 2025. Mr Bennahum, Bitkraft, Mr Gilo and his Gibraltar family trusts now all face a substantial claim for damages by Play (Ready Gibraltar) having undertaken to the court to pay damages in the event that it found that the freezing and trust preservation orders should not have been made. That is exactly what the court has found. Ready Gibraltar will now pursue that claim with the full support of its legal team,” said James Ramsden KC, Astraea Group, in a statement.\n“This victory belongs to the PLAY community – it demonstrates the importance of justice and integrity in the crypto and gaming industries. We faced false accusations and destructive tactics designed to undermine and destroy our ecosystem and $PLAY token – but the courts upheld the truth, exposing those who attempted to ruin the $PLAY token through greed. The Courts have now stated three times that PLAY did nothing wrong and that bad-faith litigation has consequences. As a leader in Web3, I am committed to protecting our community from bad actors and ensuring we will continue to pioneer innovative, onchain games – and work towards recouping the damages from this trio,” said Christina Macedo, CEO of Play Network, in a statement.\nThe Supreme Court of Gibraltar will shortly hear PLAY’s application for Bitkraft and the trio to pay approximately $2.8 million in security for costs in addition to at least $30 million in damages.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

Trellix put out a report dubbed “Demystifying Myth Stealer: A Rust Based InfoStealer,” written by Niranjan Hegde, Vasantha Lakshmanan Ambasankar and AdarshS.\nInfostealers are a type of\nmalware\nthat infiltrates computer systems and has the functionality to collect passwords, cookies, credit card information, autocomplete data, browsing history, and file download history from browsers.\nA sample written in\nRust\nmeans that the malware has been written using a specific programming language known as “Rust” diverging from common programming languages such as C/C++ in which previous malwares have been written. It is more widely understood and analyzed by threat researchers and defenders.\nThe advantage of using “Rust” is maximum platform support in terms of the operating system on which this malware can be executed, potentially widening the exposure for victim organizations.\nMyth Stealer is the name of the Rust-based malware that was actively promoted on Telegram, offering advanced features that make it highly appealing to cybercriminals. The group behind this malware is not setting up the gaming sites; rather, they provide a subscription to the malware. The attackers who then subscribe to this particular malware are the ones setting up gaming sites.\nInitially, it was offered for free for trial and later evolved to a subscription-based model. The investigation revealed that this infostealer is distributed through various fraudulent gaming websites. Upon execution, the malware displays a fake window to appear legitimate while simultaneously decrypting and executing malicious code in the background.\nThe infostealer targets both Gecko-based and Chromium-based browsers, extracting sensitive data including passwords, cookies, and autofill information. It also contains anti-analysis techniques such as string obfuscation and system checks using filenames and username.\nThe malware authors regularly update stealer code to evade AV detection and introduce additional functionality such as screen capture capability and clipboard hijacking.\nThis post was made in late December 2024. A Telegram channel was used to share updates about the Myth Stealer malware. An organized team likely developed and maintained it, based on activity in the channel.\nAfter Telegram shut down the initial channel, the operators created a new group to continue sharing malware updates. They routinely announce new versions in this group, emphasizing zero detection rates on VirusTotal. Users need to rebuild the malware to integrate the latest updates into their builds.\nCurrently, the malware is offered on a weekly and monthly subscription basis. It can be purchased using crypto-currency and Razer Gold. Additionally, they maintained a separate channel titled ‘Myth Vouches & Marketplace,’ where the users of this stealer provide testimonials and advertise the sale of compromised accounts obtained using this stealer. It is currently shut down by Telegram.\nIn another instance, we uncovered an actor who had posted a link to a malicious RAR file in an online forum under the guise of a cheat software named “ddtrace krx ultimate Crack”. To establish credibility within the forum community, the actor provided a Virustotal Link which showed zero detection at that time.\nMyth Stealer presented as a crack of a game cheating software in an online forum. Capabilities As per our investigation, the malware evolved over a period of time. Initially, when distributed as a free trial version, it only stole data from applications.\nWhen it transitioned to a subscription based model, it was sold with additional functionalities such as displaying a fake window, taking screenshots, clipboard hijacking etc. The team behind this malware keeps refactoring and updating the code to ensure that the malware has no detection in VirusTotal.\nThese updates include changing libraries used to display a fake window, updating the communication with the C2 server etc. In the following sections, the researchers detailed various functionalities shown by the malware across its different versions.\nCurrently, the malware is a 64-bit sample written in Rust containing a loader which decrypts and executes the stealer component. Loader with a fake window Once the malware is successfully downloaded and executed in the victim’s machine , the loader displays a fake window to the user.\nThese fake windows are used to fool the victim into thinking that a legitimate application is executed. It uses the Rust crate: native-windows-gui or egui or native_dailog to create and display the fake window.\nSome of the fake windows displayed by the loader. While the fake window is shown to the victim, the loader decrypts the stealer component using either XOR or AES encryption, utilizing the Rust crate include-crypt. In recent versions, the loader uses a custom algorithm to decrypt the stealer component.\nConclusion\nThe newly emerged Rust-based infostealer, Myth Stealer, continues to evolve across its versions, making it progressively harder for endpoint solutions to detect. Its use of string obfuscation, stealthy C2 communication, and features like a fake window reflect the threat actors’ advanced evasion techniques.\nThe consistent development and enhancement of Myth Stealer underscore the attackers’ determination to stay ahead of security defenses, posing a serious and persistent risk to users, particularly gamers targeted through fraudulent gaming websites.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

First in line was Dean, 15, who was dressed like an Irish leprechuan. He told me he arrived at 7 a.m. Pacific time, which was about 14 hours ahead of the 9 p.m. Pacific launch. Still, he said he was glad to drop perhaps $1,000 on the $500 Switch 2 (or $50 less if you don’t buy the Mario Kart World bundle). It was his first console launch event.\nI have now spent $850 in the Nintendo Store in SF.\nAt the checkout stand, the Nintendo dignitaries were trained by their superiors to pass the console from one dignitary (Nintendo of America EVP Devon Pritchard) to another until Dean got one handed to him by Bill Trinen.\nThe San Francisco store is only the second in the U.S. and it opened just a couple of weeks ago. The other Nintendo Store is in New York City. Greg Miller, the celebrity media man, was there.\nDean, 15, was first in line at the Nintendo Store in SF for a Nintendo Switch 2.\nIt felt good to go to the console launch, even though there was a long wait and a relatively small number of people waiting at first. By the end of the evening, though, the crowds had showed up, some dressed as their favorite Nintendo characters. I walked out of the door with about $750 in merch, including my Switch 2 and its flagship game, Mario Kart World. I also got to play a couple of rounds of Knockout on the Mario Kart World game on the Switch 2. I met a creator there who remembered me as the Cuphead guy. Luckily, I did not come in last place in Mario Kart World on my second try.\nBy the time I left, the crowd had gotten longer.\nThe ornate store is a paradise for Nintendo fans, with some unique gear for San Francisco alone in the form of T-shirts and other gear. There are 12 Pikmin statues hidden throughout the store, with accessories set up at tables for favorite franchises like Mario, Princess Peach, Zelda, Pikmin, Pokemon, Splatoon, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Animal Crossing and more.\nTry before you buy.\nI suspect the Switch 2 is going to do just fine, even if most of the games are in service of the franchises. In fact, Nintendo culture is so big with things like Mario Kart and The Super Mario Bros. Movie (which did $1.4 billion at the box office) that people want to engage with it in every walk of life — including in retail stores.\nThis fan is starting young.\nEven though these “midnight launches” are increasingly rare, I encourage fans to try them once in a while. They don’t happen nearly as often as they used to, as for some companies digital sales are 95% of the entire revenues for games. I got to reminisce with fellow game journalists about how there used to be more of us around to attend events like this one.\nIt was worth it to hear the Nintendo Store employees clapping and Dean hold the first console above his head in glory as he walked out the door.\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.
