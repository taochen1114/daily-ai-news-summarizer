Today the company announced\nAgent Pay\n, a new payments program that brings the Mastercard payments system to AI chat platforms.\nGreg Ulrich, Mastercard’s chief data and AI officer, told VentureBeat in an interview that Agent Pay “closes the loop” on agentic search.\n“You want to close the loop within the experience to enable the customer experience in the most effective way possible, which is what we’re trying to enable today,” Ulrich said. “You have to make sure that everybody in the ecosystem can identify the agents and authenticate the agent to handle the transaction safely and securely.”\nOpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity can join Mastercard’s payments network, allowing other network participants — merchants, card users and financial institutions — to trust the platform’s transactions and check for any potential fraud. It also enables Mastercard to bring its fraud and transaction dispute systems to those companies.\nMastercard partnered with Microsoft, IBM, Braintree, and Checkout.com to scale Agent Pay, orchestrate the system and enhance other features for merchants.  It will also integrate Agent Pay with banks and other financial institutions.\nMaking agent searches more useful\nOver the past year, we’ve seen\nAI-powered search\nevolve from simply listing information to actively using your computer on your behalf\n. These platforms\nenable users to ask AI models to\nsearch the internet\nfor any information\n. It can offer recommendations for products or places to visit. AI search has\nproved popular\n.\nThis week, OpenAI even announced it’s\nadding shopping features to ChatGPT search\n, running on GPT-4o, in a bid to compete with Google’s long-standing dominance in product search.\nHowever, users have always found that they need to open a separate window if they see a deal.\n“We’re gonna work with the AI platform and agents so that they can get onboarded and can access the technology. But on the merchant side, they can do now things to recognize these transactions and more effectively manage the risk around this,” said Mastercard Chief Digital Officer Pablo Fourez.\nBringing these platforms into a payments system like Mastercard makes them more useful, as they can serve not only as a place where people find information, but also as a platform where users can find and transact.\nWhen AI companies are part of the payment network, it could also improve any agentic workflow built by enterprises. Imagine an agentic workflow that includes searching for new suppliers, finding a suitable supplier, helping with negotiations, drafting a contract and setting up transactions through the platform.\nThe company is discussing the integration of Agent Pay into Microsoft’s Copilot and Azure/OpenAI services.\nTokens rather than AI\nAgent Pay, however, is not based on generative AI, even though Mastercard does\nleverage the technology\nfor other products.\nAgent Pay relies on the company’s tokenization technology, which utilizes cryptography to help mask personally identifiable information (PII) during digital transactions.\n“It’s a separate number that is useless if it’s not used within the context of the transaction that you authorized,” Fourez said. “That’s achieved through cryptography that makes the transactions each transaction unique, and if someone else gets this information, they can’t do anything with it.”\nMastercard utilizes generative AI and large language models for fraud detection, which Ulrich noted works in tandem with tokenization for Agent Pay, as its AI models verify transactions for fraud once they are initiated.\nUlrich added Agent Pay lets every company and person involved in the transaction trust that “rules work in this ecosystem.”\n“We’re making sure that we safely and securely identify these players in the ecosystem, that we have a way to capture and hold the credentials securely,” he said.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

While Meta’s Llama models have accumulated over\none billion downloads\n, until now the company had not offered a first-party cloud infrastructure for developers to build applications with them.\n“This is very exciting, even without talking about Cerebras specifically,” said James Wang, a senior executive at Cerebras. “OpenAI, Anthropic, Google — they’ve built an entire new AI business from scratch, which is the AI inference business. Developers who are building AI apps will buy tokens by the millions, by the billions sometimes. And these are just like the new compute instructions that people need to build AI applications.”\nA benchmark chart shows Cerebras processing Llama 4 at 2,648 tokens per second, dramatically outpacing competitors SambaNova (747), Groq (600) and GPU-based services from Google and others — explaining Meta’s hardware choice for its new API. (Credit: Cerebras)\nBreaking the speed barrier: How Cerebras supercharges Llama models\nWhat sets Meta’s offering apart is the dramatic speed increase provided by Cerebras’ specialized AI chips. The Cerebras system delivers over\n2,600 tokens per second\nfor Llama 4 Scout, compared to approximately 130 tokens per second for ChatGPT and around 25 tokens per second for DeepSeek, according to benchmarks from\nArtificial Analysis\n.\n“If you just compare on API-to-API basis, Gemini and GPT, they’re all great models, but they all run at GPU speeds, which is roughly about 100 tokens per second,” Wang explained. “And 100 tokens per second is okay for chat, but it’s very slow for reasoning. It’s very slow for agents. And people are struggling with that today.”\nThis speed advantage enables entirely new categories of applications that were previously impractical, including real-time agents, conversational low-latency voice systems, interactive code generation, and instant multi-step reasoning — all of which require chaining multiple large language model calls that can now be completed in seconds rather than minutes.\nFrom open source to revenue stream: Meta’s AI business transformation\nThe\nLlama API\nrepresents a significant shift in Meta’s AI strategy, transitioning from primarily being a model provider to becoming a full-service AI infrastructure company. By offering an API service, Meta is creating a revenue stream from its AI investments while maintaining its commitment to open models.\n“Meta is now in the business of selling tokens, and it’s great for the American kind of AI ecosystem,” Wang noted during the press conference. “They bring a lot to the table.”\nThe API will offer tools for fine-tuning and evaluation, starting with\nLlama 3.3 8B model\n, allowing developers to generate data, train on it, and test the quality of their custom models. Meta emphasizes that it won’t use customer data to train its own models, and models built using the Llama API can be transferred to other hosts—a clear differentiation from some competitors’ more closed approaches.\nInside Cerebras’ North American data center network powering Meta’s AI ambitions\nCerebras will power Meta’s new service through its network of\ndata centers\nlocated throughout North America, including facilities in Dallas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Montreal, and California.\n“All of our data centers that serve inference are in North America at this time,” Choi explained. “We will be serving Meta with the full capacity of Cerebras. The workload will be balanced across all of these different data centers.”\nThe business arrangement follows what Choi described as “the classic compute provider to a hyperscaler” model, similar to how Nvidia provides hardware to major cloud providers. “They are reserving blocks of our compute that they can serve their developer population,” she said.\nBeyond Cerebras,\nMeta has also announced a partnership with Groq\nto provide fast inference options, giving developers multiple high-performance alternatives beyond traditional GPU-based inference.\nDisrupting the AI ecosystem: How Meta’s 20x performance leap changes the game\nMeta’s entry into the inference API market with superior performance metrics could potentially disrupt the established order dominated by\nOpenAI\n,\nGoogle\n, and\nAnthropic\n. By combining the popularity of its open-source models with dramatically faster inference capabilities, Meta is positioning itself as a formidable competitor in the commercial AI space.\n“Meta is in a unique position with 3 billion users, hyper-scale datacenters, and a huge developer ecosystem,” according to Cerebras’ presentation materials. The integration of Cerebras technology “helps Meta leapfrog OpenAI and Google in performance by approximately 20x.”\nFor Cerebras, this partnership represents a major milestone and validation of its specialized AI hardware approach. “We have been building this wafer-scale engine for years, and we always knew that the technology’s first rate, but ultimately it has to end up as part of someone else’s hyperscale cloud. That was the final target from a commercial strategy perspective, and we have finally reached that milestone,” Wang said.\nHow developers can access Meta’s ultra-fast Llama models today\nThe\nLlama API\nis currently available as a limited preview, with Meta planning a broader rollout in the coming weeks and months. Developers interested in accessing the ultra-fast Llama 4 inference can request early access by selecting Cerebras from the model options within the Llama API.\n“If you imagine a developer who doesn’t know anything about Cerebras because we’re a relatively small company, they can just click two buttons on Meta’s standard software SDK, generate an API key, select the Cerebras flag, and then all of a sudden, their tokens are being processed on a giant wafer-scale engine,” Wang explained. “That kind of having us be on the back end of Meta’s whole developer ecosystem is just tremendous for us.”\nMeta’s choice of specialized silicon signals something profound: in the next phase of AI, it’s not just what your models know, but how quickly they can think it. In that future, speed isn’t just a feature—it’s the whole point.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

It requires a Meta products account to log in, though users can sign-in with their existing Facebook or Instagram profiles.\nIt comes ahead of the kickoff of\nLlamacon 2025\n, Meta’s first AI developer conference taking place this week at its office campus headquarters in Palo Alto, California, centered around its Llama model family and general AI developer tools and advances.\nWith the rise of more AI model challengers in the open source and proprietary domains — including everyone from OpenAI with ChatGPT to Google with its Gemini 2.5 model family and lesser-known (at least, to Western audiences) brands like\nAlibaba’s new Qwen 3\n— Meta is keen to show off the power and capabilities of its own, in-house Llama 4 models.\nIt is also seeking to make the case to third-party software developers that Llama 4 is a powerful and flexible open(ish) source model family they can trust to build their enterprise products atop of. However, with this new Meta AI app launch, I’m not sure it is the most successful example. More on that below.\nText, image, and voice out-of-the-box — with document editing coming\nThe Meta AI app represents a new way for users to interact with Meta’s AI assistant beyond existing integrations with WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger.\nIt enables users to have natural, back-and-forth voice conversations with AI, edit and generate images, and discover new use cases through a curated Discover feed featuring prompts and ideas shared by the community.\nAlongside traditional text interaction, Meta AI now supports voice functionality while multitasking. An early full-duplex voice demo allows users to experience natural, flowing conversations where the AI generates speech directly, rather than simply reading text aloud.\nHowever, the demo does not access real-time web information and may display occasional technical inconsistencies. Voice features, including the full-duplex demo, are currently available in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\nOn the web, meta.ai has been revamped to mirror the mobile experience, offering voice interaction, access to the Discover feed, and an improved image generation tool with enhanced style, mood, and lighting controls.\nThe web version seems especially powerful and capable for image creation, with many pre-set styles and aspect ratios to choose from. In my brief hands-on tests with the mobile app, the image creation tools seemed far more limited and I wasn’t able to find a way to switch the aspect ratio. In both formats, the image quality was far lower than dedicated and rival AI image generators such as Midjourney or OpenAI’s GPT-4o native image generation.\nMeta is also testing a rich document editor and document analysis features in select countries.\nDiscover what other users are doing and creating with AI\nA standout feature of the app is its “Discover” section, available by swiping up from the main chatbot interface, where users can browse and remix prompts, ideas, and creative outputs shared by others.\nThis feed highlights how people are using Meta AI to brainstorm, write, analyze social media content, create stylized images, and explore playful concepts — such as designing pixel-art scenes or seeking AI-generated companions.\nPosts from creators include both text-based prompts and image results, giving others a starting point to experiment with the AI in new ways. It also coincides with\ntech journalist Alex Kantrowitz’s (Big Technology) recent observation in a LinkedIn post\nthat AI is steadily replacing social media as a means of entertainment and content discovery for a growing number of users.\nThis peer-sharing dynamic aligns with Meta’s intent to make AI not only useful but culturally engaging, offering a social layer to what is traditionally a one-on-one assistant interaction.\nSeeing the future\nFor users of the augmented reality Ray-Ban Meta glasses, the Meta AI app replaces the former Meta View app.\nExisting device pairings, settings, and media content will migrate automatically upon updating.\nThis integration enables users to move from interacting with their glasses to the app, maintaining conversation history and access across devices and the web, although conversations cannot yet be initiated on the app and resumed on glasses.\nMemory and personalization\nPersonalization stands at the core of the new Meta AI experience.\nUsers can instruct Meta AI to remember certain interests and preferences, and the assistant also draws from user profiles and engagement history on Meta platforms to tailor responses.\nThis feature is currently available in the U.S. and Canada. Users who link their Facebook and Instagram accounts through the Meta Accounts Center can benefit from deeper personalization.\nWhen I downloaded the app to try it, it automatically suggested and pre-filled my Instagram account login.\nQuick hands-on test\nMy initial tests of the Meta AI app interface reveal both the impressive functionality of Llama 4 and its current limitations in everyday tasks.\nOn the one hand, the assistant is capable of generating helpful responses, offering analysis and advice, and generating images rapidly.\nHowever, some interactions expose severe limitations that have been mostly solved in other AI apps and the large language models (LLMs) powering them behind the scenes.\nIn one case, Meta AI initially miscounted the number of ‘M’s in the word “Mommy,” correcting itself only after being prompted to review its answer.\nA similar pattern occurred when counting the letter ‘R’ in “Strawberry,” where it first responded with 2 before correcting to 3 after further clarification.\nAnother response incorrectly evaluated which number is larger between 9.11 and 9.9, a task involving basic decimal comparison.\nThese moments underscore the model’s limitations when it comes to attention to detail in short factual reasoning tasks — a known area where even advanced language models can falter.\nThe assistant’s ability to acknowledge mistakes, explain its reasoning, and offer transparent corrections reflects progress toward more interactive and self-correcting AI experiences.\nBut overall, I can’t recommend it being used for workplaces right now.\nMeta’s broader vision\nSpeaking about the broader strategy in a video and audio interview with AI focused\nYouTuber and podcaster Dwarkesh Patel\n, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized that personalization and seamless, low-latency interaction are priorities for the company’s AI development.\n“If you fast-forward a few years, I think we’re just going to be talking to AI throughout the day about different things we’re wondering about,” Zuckerberg said.\nHe highlighted the company’s focus on building systems that are quick, natively multimodal, and integrated deeply into daily life.\nZuckerberg also discussed Meta’s approach to open-source AI, noting that Llama 4 models are designed to balance efficiency, intelligence, and accessibility.\nHe reinforced that Meta’s commitment to open-source AI development aims to ensure broad innovation while maintaining American leadership in AI model standards, particularly in securing values and system integrity.\nEveryday AI?\nAs Meta positions itself to compete in the increasingly crowded personal AI market, the launch of the Meta AI app marks a significant step toward making intelligent, personalized assistants part of everyday life for millions of users worldwide.\nWith active user feedback and a growing repository of shared use cases through the Discover feed, Meta is clearly investing in an ecosystem where AI evolves in tandem with community engagement and real-world demands.\nThe big takeaway for enterprises: Meta AI is likely to redefine customer expectations across sectors\nWhile the Meta AI app is designed first and foremost for consumers, its launch carries broader implications for businesses across every sector.\nMeta, with an audience of\nnearly 4 billion users globally\nacross its apps and hardware products, has the scale to fundamentally shift public expectations around technology.\nEven if only a small fraction of its users download and engage with the Meta AI app, it will introduce millions — possibly hundreds of millions — of non-technical consumers to regular, casual interaction with AI, and showcase the possibilities for conversational interaction in text and voice, rapid image generation, and problem solving.\nThis mainstream exposure will likely accelerate a shift in what people expect not just from consumer apps, but from workplaces, service providers, retailers, and every kind of merchant or vendor they interact with.\nWhen individuals grow accustomed to personalized, conversational AI that can understand context, anticipate needs, and assist with creative or informational tasks, they will expect and demand similar functionality everywhere — from their own workplaces and those businesses and enterprises they purchase from.\nBusinesses that do not offer accessible, responsive AI-driven experiences risk feeling outdated or unresponsive compared to what consumers increasingly take for granted.\nIn effect, Meta’s new app may not simply compete with other AI offerings; it could redefine the baseline for digital interaction standards across industries.\nEnterprises, regardless of size or sector, will need to rethink how they incorporate AI into customer experiences, service channels, and even internal operations if they want to meet the new cultural expectations this widespread consumer familiarity with AI is about to establish.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
