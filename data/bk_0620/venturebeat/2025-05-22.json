OpenAI said at that time that the Chat Completions API would be deprecated by mid 2026.\nThe Responses API provides visibility into model decisions, access to real-time data, and integration capabilities that allowed agents to retrieve, reason over, and act on information.\nThis launch marked a shift toward giving developers a unified toolkit for creating production-ready, domain-specific AI agents with minimal friction.\nRemote MCP server support broadens integration potential\nA key addition in this update is support for remote MCP servers. Developers can now connect OpenAI’s models to external tools and services such as Stripe, Shopify, and Twilio using only a few lines of code. This capability enables the creation of agents that can take actions and interact with systems users already depend on. To support this evolving ecosystem, OpenAI has joined the MCP steering committee.\nAccess to new tools: native image gen and Code Interpreter\nThe update brings new built-in tools to the Responses API that enhance what agents can do within a single API call.\nA variant of OpenAI’s hit GPT-4o native image generation model — which inspired a wave of “Studio Ghibli” style anime memes around the web and buckled OpenAI’s servers with its popularity, but can obviously create many other image styles — is now available through the API under the model name “gpt-image-1.” It includes potentially helpful and fairly impressive new features like real-time streaming previews and multi-turn refinement.\nThis enables developers to build applications that can produce and edit images dynamically in response to user input.\nAdditionally, the Code Interpreter tool is now integrated into the Responses API, allowing models to handle data analysis, complex math, and logic-based tasks within their reasoning processes.\nThe tool helps improve model performance across various technical benchmarks and allows for more sophisticated agent behavior.\nImproved file search and context handling\nThe file search functionality has also been upgraded. Developers can now perform searches across multiple vector stores and apply attribute-based filtering to retrieve only the most relevant content.\nThis improves the precision of information agents use, enhancing their ability to answer complex questions and operate within large knowledge domains.\nNew enterprises reliability, transparency features\nSeveral features are designed specifically to meet enterprise needs. Background mode allows for long-running asynchronous tasks, addressing issues of timeouts or network interruptions during intensive reasoning.\nReasoning summaries, a new addition, offer natural-language explanations of the model’s internal thought process, helping with debugging and transparency.\nEncrypted reasoning items provide an additional privacy layer for Zero Data Retention customers.\nThese allow models to reuse previous reasoning steps without storing any data on OpenAI servers, improving both security and efficiency.\nThe latest capabilities are supported across OpenAI’s GPT-4o series, GPT-4.1 series, and the o-series models, including o3 and o4-mini. These models now maintain reasoning state across multiple tool calls and requests, which leads to more accurate responses at lower cost and latency.\nYesterday’s price IS today’s price!\nDespite the expanded feature set, OpenAI has confirmed that pricing for the new tools and capabilities within the Responses API will remain consistent with existing rates.\nFor example, the Code Interpreter tool is priced at $0.03 per session, and file search usage is billed at $2.50 per 1,000 calls, with storage costs of $0.10 per GB per day after the first free gigabyte.\nWeb search pricing varies based on the model and search context size, ranging from $25 to $50 per 1,000 calls. Image generation through the gpt-image-1 tool is also charged according to resolution and quality tier, starting at $0.011 per image.\nAll tool usage is billed at the chosen model’s per-token rates, with no additional markup for the newly added capabilities.\nWhat’s next for the Responses API?\nWith these updates, OpenAI continues to expand what is possible with the Responses API. Developers gain access to a richer set of tools and enterprise-ready features, while enterprises can now build more integrated, capable, and secure AI-driven applications.\nAll features are live as of May 21, with pricing and implementation details available through OpenAI’s documentation.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The company has teamed up with open source startup\nAll Hands AI\n, creators of Open Devin to release\nDevstral\n, a new open-source language model with 24-million parameters — much smaller than many rivals whose models are in the multibillions, and thus, requiring far less computing power such that it can be run on a laptop — purpose-built for agentic AI development.\nUnlike traditional LLMs designed for short-form code completions or isolated function generation, Devstral is optimized to act as a full software engineering agent—capable of understanding context across files, navigating large codebases, and resolving real-world issues.\nThe model is now freely available under the\npermissive Apache 2.0 license\n, allowing developers and organizations to deploy, modify, and commercialize it without restriction.\n“We wanted to release something open for the developer and enthusiast community—something they can run locally, privately, and modify as they want,” said Baptiste Rozière, research scientist at Mistral AI. “It’s released under Apache 2.0, so people can do basically whatever they want with it.”\nBuilding upon Codestral\nDevstral represents the next step in Mistral’s growing portfolio of code-focused models, following its earlier success with the Codestral series.\nFirst launched in\nMay 2024, Codestral\nwas Mistral’s initial foray into specialized coding LLMs. It was a 22-billion-parameter model trained to handle over 80 programming languages and became well-regarded for its performance in code generation and completion tasks.\nThe model’s popularity and technical strengths led to rapid iterations, including the launch of Codestral-Mamba—an enhanced version built on Mamba architecture—and most recently, Codestral 25.01, which has found adoption among IDE plugin developers and enterprise users looking for high-frequency, low-latency models.\nThe momentum around Codestral helped establish Mistral as a key player in the coding-model ecosystem and laid the foundation for the development of Devstral—extending from fast completions to full-agent task execution.\nOutperforms larger models on top SWE benchmarks\nDevstral achieves a score of 46.8% on the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, a dataset of 500 real-world GitHub issues manually validated for correctness.\nThis places it ahead of all previously released open-source models and ahead of several closed models, including GPT-4.1-mini, which it surpasses by over 20 percentage points.\n“Right now, it’s by pretty far the best open model for SWE-bench verified and for code agents,” said Rozière. “And it’s also a very small model—only 24 billion parameters—that you can run locally, even on a MacBook.”\n“Compare Devstral to closed and open models evaluated under any scaffold—we find that Devstral achieves substantially better performance than a number of closed-source alternatives,” wrote Sophia Yang, Ph.D., Head of Developer Relations at Mistral AI, on\nthe social network X\n. “For example, Devstral surpasses the recent GPT-4.1-mini by over 20%.”\nThe model is finetuned from Mistral Small 3.1 using reinforcement learning and safety alignment techniques.\n“We started from a very good base model with Mistral’s small tree control, which already performs well,” Rozière said. “Then we specialized it using safety and reinforcement learning techniques to improve its performance on SWE-bench.”\nBuilt for the agentic era\nDevstral is not just a code generation model — it is optimized for integration into agentic frameworks like OpenHands, SWE-Agent, and OpenDevin.\nThese scaffolds allow Devstral to interact with test cases, navigate source files, and execute multi-step tasks across projects.\n“We’re releasing it with OpenDevin, which is a scaffolding for code agents,” said Rozière. “We build the model, and they build the scaffolding — a set of prompts and tools that the model can use, like a backend for the developer model.”\nTo ensure robustness, the model was tested across diverse repositories and internal workflows.\n“We were very careful not to overfit to SWE-bench,” Rozière explained. “We trained only on data from repositories that are not cloned from the SWE-bench set and validated the model across different frameworks.”\nHe added that Mistral dogfooded Devstral internally to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen tasks.\nEfficient deployment with permissive open license — even for enterprise and commercial projects\nDevstral’s compact 24B architecture makes it practical for developers to run locally, whether on a single RTX 4090 GPU or a Mac with 32GB of RAM. This makes it appealing for privacy-sensitive use cases and edge deployments.\n“This model is targeted toward enthusiasts and people who care about running something locally and privately—something they can use even on a plane with no internet,” Rozière said.\nBeyond performance and portability, its Apache 2.0 license offers a compelling proposition for commercial applications. The license permits unrestricted use, adaptation, and distribution—even for proprietary products—making Devstral a low-friction option for enterprise adoption.\nDetailed specifications and usage instructions are available on the\nDevstral-Small-2505 model card on Hugging Face\n.\nThe model features a 128,000 token context window and uses the Tekken tokenizer with a 131,000\nvocabulary.\nIt supports deployment through all major open source platforms including Hugging Face, Ollama, Kaggle, LM Studio, and Unsloth, and works well with libraries such as vLLM, Transformers, and Mistral Inference.\nAvailable via API or locally\nDevstral is accessible via\nMistral’s Le Platforme API\n(application programming interface) under the model name devstral-small-2505, with pricing set at $0.10 per million input tokens and $0.30 per million output tokens.\nFor those deploying locally, support for frameworks like OpenHands enables integration with codebases and agentic workflows out of the box.\nRozière shared how he incorporates Devstral in his own development flow: “I use it myself. You can ask it to do small tasks, like updating the version of a package or modifying a tokenization script. It finds the right place in your code and makes the changes. It’s really nice to use.”\nMore to come\nWhile Devstral is currently released as a research preview, Mistral and All Hands AI are already working on a larger follow-up model with expanded capabilities. “There will always be a gap between smaller and larger models,” Rozière noted, “but we’ve gone a long way in bridging that. These models already perform very strongly, even compared to some larger competitors.”\nWith its performance benchmarks, permissive license, and agentic design, Devstral positions itself not just as a code generation tool—but as a foundational model for building autonomous software engineering systems.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
