Read on to find out.\nStrong user demand drives mobile release\nThe mobile app addresses one of the most frequent user requests: a way to use NotebookLM beyond the desktop.\nAccording to\na blog post by Biao Wang, Product Manager at Google Labs\n, many users wanted the ability to listen to summaries, interact with AI hosts and share content to NotebookLM directly from their phones.\nThe release has seen strong early momentum. Within 24 hours of launch, the\napp reached the number two position in the Productivity category\nof the Apple App Store and placed ninth overall.\nMeanwhile, traffic analytics firm\nSimilarweb reported that monthly visits to NotebookLM’s platform increased by 56%\nover the past six months to more than 48 million vists, citing a strong adoption rate.\nMobile-first features focus on offline and multitasking\nThe NotebookLM mobile app introduces several features tailored for on-the-go usage.\nUsers can download Audio Overviews—AI-generated podcast discussions of uploaded documents or media—for offline playback. This is a huge unlock for those wanting to take audio summaries with them on hikes, on the subway, or anywhere cell and wireless service is lacking.\nUsers can continue listening without interruption, whether commuting or dealing with limited connectivity.\nAdditionally, Audio Overviews support background playback, enabling users to listen while using other apps or performing other tasks on their devices.\nInteractive AI hosts add dynamic engagement\nThe mobile experience has a new layer of interactivity. When connected to the internet, users can tap a “Join” button during playback to ask the AI hosts questions, redirect the summary flow, or even request light-hearted content.\nThis real-time engagement allows for a more personalized and flexible understanding of complex materials.\nEasy content sharing from any app\nThe app also streamlines the process of adding new source materials. Users browsing a website, viewing a PDF, or watching a YouTube video can share that content directly to NotebookLM via their phone’s native share menu.\nThe initial version supports three input types—websites, PDFs and YouTube links—with more formats planned for future updates.\nAvailable now on iOS and Android\nNotebookLM’s app is available immediately for download. It supports iPhones and iPads running iOS 17 or later, as well as Android phones and tablets running Android 10 or higher.\nThe version released is described as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), with ongoing improvements expected based on user input.\nThe development team has encouraged feedback through social media and its community channels, particularly around which features from the web app should be prioritized for mobile use.\nVideo Overviews on the way\nIn addition to the launch, NotebookLM previewed a new feature: Video Overviews. The feature will arrive soon in English, allowing users to generate brief, animated video summaries from various content types, including PDFs and images.\nThe mobile release represents a key step in NotebookLM’s ongoing product evolution. It aims to make information analysis and comprehension accessible in more contexts, whether users are at their desks or on the go.\nHands-on experience with NotebookLM iOS app shows promise and pitfalls\nMy initial hands-on tests of the iOS version of NotebookLM revealed a mix of promise and performance gaps.\nThe core flow—pasting a URL to add it as a source, generating summaries and interacting with the AI—is intuitive and consistent with the web version’s focus on simplifying complex content.\nFor instance, a source titled\nExplained: Neural Networks\nloaded successfully, created an overview with 7 sources, and allowed playback of an Audio Overview with standard controls like rewind, fast forward and playback speed adjustments.\nHowever, the experience wasn’t entirely smooth.\nThe app shows inconsistent behavior when trying to add URLs as sources. In multiple cases, adding a website URL failed, resulting in the error message\n“Could not add source.”\nThis occurred even with typical educational content (e.g., pages about how large language models work).\nThe app did not provide details about why these URLs failed, whether due to unsupported formats, site restrictions or network issues. This lack of feedback makes troubleshooting difficult for users.\nWhile switching between notebooks, the app occasionally displayed a message stating\n“Could not load notebooks.”\nThis occurred while navigating between previously created notebooks and attempting to create or access new ones.\nThe loading message\n“This may take 10–20 seconds”\nappeared frequently but didn’t always resolve, potentially leaving users uncertain about whether an operation was actually successful or not.\nUI polish and real-time response\nThe interface itself is visually clean and consistent with Google’s Material Design patterns.\nHowever, subtle usability delays—such as loading animations persisting for longer than necessary or summary generation pauses—detract from the sense of real-time responsiveness, especially for users familiar with the web app’s speed.\nDespite the above issues, some key promises of the mobile app were validated in use. My Audio Overview of Microsoft’s Build 2025 keynote address played back reliably in offline mode.\nThe app allowed me to play content in the background while switching to other apps, meeting the multi-tasking support claims outlined in the launch announcement.\nNotebookLM on iOS delivers on its foundational promise—bringing AI-assisted understanding to mobile devices—but early users may encounter reliability challenges around content ingestion and notebook management.\nEnterprise implications: Why IT leaders and team managers should take notice\nFor enterprise decision-makers—CTOs, IT admins and team leads—NotebookLM is becoming more than just a personal productivity tool.\nWith the introduction of NotebookLM Business and now NotebookLM Plus, Google is signaling its intent to support professional-grade applications for research, collaboration and knowledge management across organizations.\nOriginally launched as an AI note-taking tool built with Gemini 1.5 and later upgraded with Flash 2.0, NotebookLM has already proven popular among students, researchers and knowledge workers. However, as usage has expanded, so has Google’s roadmap. NotebookLM Business (now referred to in public updates as NotebookLM Plus) introduces features aimed squarely at enterprise users:\nExpanded capacity\n: Up to 5x more notebooks, sources and Audio Overviews.\nCollaboration tools\n: Notebook sharing, shared editing, and customization options for tone, format and style.\nUsage analytics\n: Insight into how teams are interacting with shared content.\nAudio enhancements\n: Team members can generate and interact with narrated overviews and use voice-based questions to explore sources.\nIntegration readiness\n: Designed for Google Workspace and now Google Agentspace, with inclusion in the Google One AI Premium plan expected in 2026.\nNotebookLM’s value proposition for enterprise teams centers on its\nRAG (retrieval-augmented generation)\nmodel, where users can create centralized, queryable knowledge bases based on source materials. Teams can store slide decks, policy documents, onboarding material, product roadmaps or even CRM-style interaction logs—all inside shared notebooks. This can dramatically reduce search time and context-switching, particularly in knowledge-heavy functions like legal, marketing, product development or research.\nIn an\nOct. 2024 interview with VentureBeat\n, Google noted that early business users reported success using NotebookLM to build “a centralized repository of team intelligence”—a feature that can help with project onboarding, briefing and knowledge continuity across time zones and departments.\nWhile still experimental, NotebookLM’s Audio Overview feature also holds potential for enterprise knowledge dissemination. Teams can use it to generate short, spoken summaries of complex materials—ideal for briefings, podcast-style internal communications, or summarizing new product documentation. Recent updates even allow users to guide the conversation or prompt deeper dives into specific topics during playback.\nPrivacy and control for professional environments\nA recent onboarding screen in the app emphasizes that NotebookLM does not use personal data to train models.\nFor enterprise or EDU accounts using Google Drive, data handling is governed by Workspace or Education terms of service, reinforcing compliance standards. This distinction may help NotebookLM pass initial IT reviews for adoption in regulated industries or organizations with sensitive data concerns.\nWhile the app still includes warnings about the potential for inaccuracies—common to generative tools—NotebookLM is positioned as a knowledge assistant, not a decision-maker. IT leads evaluating it for broader use should weigh these limits alongside the tool’s productivity and information management strengths.\nEarly enterprise users already onboard\nNotably, some early adopters in the startup and venture capital sectors have already embraced NotebookLM as a replacement for traditional CRMs or internal wikis. Sam Lessin, former Meta VP of Product and current general partner at Slow Ventures, described using NotebookLM instead of a CRM. Others report building knowledge hubs around everything from regulatory compliance to code documentation.\nAs NotebookLM matures, its emerging business-tier capabilities suggest growing alignment with modern teams’ productivity and compliance needs.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

And the world is responding, adopting AI faster than ever before,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, during a press briefing ahead of the conference. “What all this progress means is that we’re in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people, businesses and communities all over the world.”\nEnhanced reasoning: Gemini 2.5 models introduce revolutionary “Deep Think” capabilities\nAt the center of Google’s announcements is the continued evolution of its\nGemini large language models\n, with significant improvements to both the\nPro\nand\nFlash\nversions. The updated\nGemini 2.5 Flash\nwill be generally available in early June, with Pro following shortly after.\nMost notable is the introduction of “\nDeep Think\n,” an enhanced reasoning mode for the Pro model that Google claims delivers breakthrough performance on complex tasks by using parallel thinking techniques. The company says this approach allows the model to consider multiple possibilities simultaneously, similar to how AlphaGo revolutionized game playing.\n“Deep Think pushes model performance to its limits, delivering groundbreaking results,” said Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, during the press briefing. “It gets an impressive score on USAMO 2025, one of the hardest maths benchmarks. It also leads on LiveCodeBench, a benchmark for competition-level coding.”\nThe company is proceeding cautiously with\nDeep Think\n, planning to first make it available to trusted testers for feedback before wider release. This measured approach reflects Google’s emphasis on responsible AI deployment, especially for frontier capabilities that push the boundaries of what AI can accomplish.\nReimagining search: AI Mode expands with personalization and agentic features\nGoogle is bringing AI deeper into its core search product, rolling out “\nAI Mode\n” to all U.S. users after previously limiting it to Labs testers. This alternative search experience uses a technique called “\nquery fan-out\n” to break questions into subtopics and issue multiple simultaneous searches, delivering more comprehensive results than traditional search.\n“AI Mode is our most powerful AI search with more advanced reasoning and multimodality, and the ability to go deeper through follow-up questions and helpful links to the web,” said Liz Reid, VP and Head of Google Search.\nThe company revealed impressive metrics around its existing\nAI Overviews\nfeature, which now reaches more than 1.5 billion users. “In our biggest markets like the U.S. and India, AI overviews is driving over 10% increase in usage of Google for the types of queries that show AI overviews,” Reid noted during the preview.\nNew features coming to AI Mode include\nDeep Search\nfor comprehensive research reports, Live capabilities for real-time visual assistance, and personalization options that can incorporate data from users’ Google accounts. This personalization, which requires explicit user opt-in, aims to deliver more relevant results by understanding individual preferences and contexts.\nVirtual fitting rooms: Shopping experience transformed with AI try-on technology\nGoogle is making a significant push into AI-powered shopping experiences, introducing a\nvirtual try-on feature\nthat allows users to see how clothes would look on them using just a single photo of themselves. The technology represents a major advancement in making online shopping more intuitive and personalized.\n“This is a situation where I found maybe five dresses that I like, and I see how it looks on the website and on the models there. However, I look nothing like those models, and I’m wondering which one will really work for me,” explained Vidhya Srinivasan, VP and General Manager of Ads and Commerce.\nThe system is powered by a specialized image generation model designed specifically for fashion applications. According to Srinivasan, it has “a very deep understanding of 3D shapes” and fabrics, allowing it to realistically render how clothing items would drape and fit on different body types.\nBeyond visual try-on, Google is also introducing\nagentic checkout\ncapabilities that can automatically complete purchases when items reach a user-specified price point. This feature handles the entire checkout process through\nGoogle Pay\n, showcasing how Google is applying its agentic AI capabilities to streamline everyday tasks.\nAudio-visual breakthrough: Generative media evolves with Veo 3 and Imagen 4\nGoogle unveiled significant upgrades to its generative media models, introducing\nVeo 3\nfor video generation and\nImagen 4\nfor images. The most dramatic advancement comes in Veo 3’s ability to generate videos with synchronized audio — including ambient sounds, effects, and character dialogue.\n“For the first time, we’re emerging from the silent era of video generation,” said Hassabis. “Not only does Veo 3 offer even more stunning visual quality, but it can also generate sound effects, background noises and even dialog.”\nThese advanced models power\nFlow\n, Google’s new\nAI filmmaking tool\ndesigned for creative professionals. Flow integrates Google’s best AI models to help storytellers create cinematic clips and scenes with a more intuitive interface.\n“Flow is inspired by what it feels like when time slows down and creation is effortless, iterative and full of possibility,” according to a company statement. The tool has already been tested with several filmmakers who have created short films using the technology in combination with traditional methods.\nImagen 4\n, meanwhile, delivers improvements in image quality, with particular attention to typography and text rendering — making it especially valuable for creating marketing materials, presentations, and other content that combines visuals and text.\nImmersive communication: Google Beam evolves from Project Starline research\nThe company announced that\nProject Starline\n, its experimental 3D video communication technology first showcased several years ago, is evolving into a commercial product called\nGoogle Beam\n. This technology creates the sensation of being in the same room with someone, even when communicating remotely.\n“Google Beam will be a new AI-first video communications platform,” Pichai explained. “Beam uses a new state-of-the-art AI video model that transforms video streams into a realistic 3D experience.”\nThe system employs an array of cameras to capture different angles of participants, then uses AI to merge these streams and render them on a 3D light field display with precise head tracking. The result is a deeply immersive conversation experience that goes beyond traditional video calling.\nGoogle has partnered with HP to bring the first\nGoogle Beam\ndevices to market for select customers later this year. The technology also introduces speech translation capabilities that preserve voice quality and expression, allowing for natural conversations across language barriers — a feature that will also be coming to Google Meet.\nPremium access: New Ultra subscription tier targets power users and professionals\nTo monetize its most advanced AI offerings, Google introduced a premium subscription tier called\nGoogle AI Ultra\n, priced at $249.99 per month. This tier provides access to Google’s most capable models, highest usage limits, and early access to experimental features.\n“If you’re a filmmaker, developer, creative professional or simply demand the absolute best of Google AI with the highest level of access, the Google AI Ultra plan is built for you — think of it as your VIP pass to Google AI,” the company stated in its press materials.\nThe Ultra plan includes access to\nVeo 3 with audio generation\n,\nDeep Think mode\nwhen available, the\nFlow filmmaking tool\n,\nProject Mariner’s\nagentic capabilities, and 30TB of storage. It also comes bundled with\nYouTube Premium\n.\n“The way to think of the Google AI Ultra plan is it’s almost like your VIP access to all of Google’s AI. So it’ll be special features, the highest rate limits. We’re also putting early access to products and features in there too,” explained Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini.\nGoogle’s standard AI Pro subscription at $19.99 monthly will continue, with some features from the Ultra tier eventually making their way to this more affordable option.\nWhere research meets reality: Google’s AI vision takes shape\nGoogle’s I/O announcements reflect a company at an inflection point, successfully transforming its vast research investments into products that could reshape how people interact with technology. The emphasis on agentic capabilities — AI that can take actions on users’ behalf — signals a significant evolution beyond the current generation of assistive AI.\n“One of the things I’ve found magical, is particularly in search… people just intuitively adapt to the power of what’s possible,” Pichai remarked. “I think the big thing people are excited about is when you make [interaction] more natural and intuitive.”\nFor businesses and developers weighing AI strategies, Google’s expanding ecosystem offers powerful tools but requires careful consideration of integration pathways, costs, and data privacy implications. The company’s dual approach of embedding AI in core products while developing premium offerings suggests a long-term strategy to both defend existing markets and create new revenue streams.\nAs these technologies move from labs to everyday use, they underscore Pichai’s observation about the current AI moment: we’re witnessing the transformation of theoretical capabilities into practical tools that respond to how people naturally work, create, and communicate. The race to build truly helpful AI isn’t just about technical capability — it’s about bringing intelligence to the moments where we need it most, in ways that feel less like using technology and more like being understood by it.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

However, during\nGoogle I/O\n, Google announced that Jules will now be available in beta.\nWith the broader release of Jules, Google positions itself as a strong competitor against a rising number of AI coding assistants designed to write, check and fix code autonomously.\nJosh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs, told reporters in a briefing that Jules “will be available to help developers fix bugs, create tests, consult documentation all happening in the background.”\n“People are describing apps into existence,” Woodward said. “This started out as an asynchronous coding agent with the idea that, what if you created a way where you could assign tasks to this agent for the things you didn’t want to do?”\nJules will be integrated into GitHub and uses Google’s\nGemini 2.5 Pro\n. During the public beta phase, developers can access Jules for free but with usage limits.\nAsynchronous and parallel\nJules works asynchronously, allowing developers to assign it a task while they work separately on something else. It runs tasks inside a virtual machine, shows tasks and their reasoning and even offers audio summaries.\nBut Jules is not the only asynchronous and parallel task coding agent on the market, nor was it the only one announced in May.\nOpenAI\nsurprised the industry by releasing a research preview of its\ncoding agent Codex\n, after rumors circulated that the company would\nbuy the coding startup\nWindsurf\n. Codex began life as a coding model but has since transformed into a coding agent able to write, fix bugs and answer codebase questions in a separate sandbox.\nCodex was also behind one of the first code completion assistants, GitHub Copilot.\nGitHub\nannounced at Microsoft Build this week a\nGitHub Copilot Agent\n, doing much of the same asynchronous work as Codex and Jules.\nSocial media is abuzz with interest in the upcoming arms race around coding agents, even before Jules and Codex were fully released to the public.\nYeah, I think Jules beats Codex by a lot. Only tested on a my lazy prompt so far \"Analyze the project and write unit tests to cover 100%\".\n– Jules plans first and creates its own tasks. Codex does not. That's major.\n– Jules VMs have internet\npic.twitter.com/DCGPKwiNiP\n— Daniel Nakov (@dnak0v)\nMay 19, 2025\n@Google\nai agent Jules just made her first contribution to a project I’m working on\nFeedback: I really wish there was a way where I could select files or directories where I would want the AI to focus on\npic.twitter.com/z5yMaF2ERb\n— Nicolas (@NicolasSerna314)\nMay 20, 2025\nSeems like Coding agents that can submit PRs are the new shiny objects. Codex from OpenAI, Copilot coding agent from GitHub/Microsoft, Jules from Google, Claude and xAI when?\n— Samuel (@SamuelSurfboard)\nMay 20, 2025\nThese more autonomous coding platforms follow\nthe growth of “vibe coding,”\nwhere code and applications are generated mostly through prompting rather than hard coding written by humans. The entrance of Big Tech companies like Google and OpenAI into this arena brings coding agents even more to the forefront of the AI arms race.\nMore AI-powered code\nEven inside Google, Jules is not the only AI coding platform for building applications. Google offers Code Assist, AI Studio, Jules and Firebase.\nFirebase,\nannounced in April\n, allows non-coders to build applications and add AI features. Google updated the platform, adding a new AI Workspace for Firebase Studio and Firebase AI Logic to monitor AI usage.\nFirebase Studio, powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro, allows users to build more sophisticated applications. Firebase AI Logic offers developers the means to add features to the app’s backend, like authentication and identity. It also allows people to check token usage or resolve latency issues without needing a third-party orchestration program.\nJeanine Banks, vice president and general manager for Developer X and head of Developer Relations at Google, told VentureBeat that Firebase differentiates itself from Jules and other Google coding products by being the first place people new to coding can experiment with making their own AI applications.\n“Google offers many wonderful tools to help you with specialized parts of your stack. So, for example, you can use Google AI Studio, which helps in experimenting with your AI inference to figure out the best optimized prompts,” Banks said. “But Firebase is the single place that integrates all of those things together, and it’s a single place for full-stack developers and professionals, but also creators who are vibe coding.”\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
