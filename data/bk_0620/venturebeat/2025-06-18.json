VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nAnthropic\nCEO Dario Amodei made an\nurgent push\nin April for the need to understand how AI models think.\nThis comes at a crucial time. As Anthropic\nbattles\nin global AI rankings, it’s important to note what sets it apart from other top AI labs. Since its founding in 2021, when seven\nOpenAI\nemployees\nbroke off\nover concerns about AI safety, Anthropic has built AI models that adhere to a set of human-valued principles, a system they call\nConstitutional AI\n. These principles ensure that models are “\nhelpful, honest and harmless\n” and generally act in the best interests of society. At the same time, Anthropic’s research arm is\ndiving deep\nto understand how its models think about the world, and\nwhy\nthey produce helpful (and sometimes harmful) answers.\nAnthropic’s flagship model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet,\ndominated\ncoding benchmarks when it launched in February, proving that AI models can excel at both performance and safety. And the recent release of Claude 4.0 Opus and Sonnet again puts Claude at the\ntop of coding benchmarks\n. However, in today’s rapid and hyper-competitive AI market, Anthropic’s rivals like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Open AI’s o3 have their own impressive showings for coding prowess, while they’re\nalready dominating\nClaude at math, creative writing and overall reasoning across many languages.\nIf Amodei’s thoughts are any indication, Anthropic is planning for the future of AI and its implications in critical fields like medicine, psychology and law, where model safety and human values are imperative. And it shows: Anthropic is the leading AI lab that focuses strictly on developing “interpretable” AI, which are models that let us understand, to some degree of certainty, what the model is thinking and how it arrives at a particular conclusion.\nAmazon and\nGoogle\nhave already invested billions of dollars in Anthropic even as they build their own AI models, so perhaps Anthropic’s competitive advantage is still budding. Interpretable models, as Anthropic suggests, could significantly reduce the long-term operational costs associated with debugging, auditing and mitigating risks in complex AI deployments.\nSayash Kapoor\n, an AI safety researcher, suggests that while interpretability is valuable, it is just one of many tools for managing AI risk. In his view, “interpretability is neither necessary nor sufficient” to ensure models behave safely — it matters most when paired with filters, verifiers and human-centered design. This more expansive view sees interpretability as part of a larger ecosystem of control strategies, particularly in real-world AI deployments where models are components in broader decision-making systems.\nThe need for interpretable AI\nUntil recently, many thought AI was still years from advancements like those that are now helping Claude, Gemini and ChatGPT\nboast\nexceptional market adoption. While these models are already\npushing the frontiers of human knowledge\n, their widespread use is attributable to just how good they are at solving a wide range of practical problems that require creative problem-solving or detailed analysis. As models are put to the task on increasingly critical problems, it is important that they produce accurate answers.\nAmodei fears that when an AI responds to a prompt, “we have no idea… why it chooses certain words over others, or why it occasionally makes a mistake despite usually being accurate.” Such errors — hallucinations of inaccurate information, or responses that do not align with human values — will hold AI models back from reaching their full potential. Indeed, we’ve seen many examples of AI continuing to struggle with\nhallucinations\nand\nunethical behavior\n.\nFor Amodei, the best way to solve these problems is to understand how an AI thinks: “Our inability to understand models’ internal mechanisms means that we cannot meaningfully predict such [harmful] behaviors, and therefore struggle to rule them out … If instead it were possible to look inside models, we might be able to systematically block all jailbreaks, and also characterize what dangerous knowledge the models have.”\nAmodei also sees the opacity of current models as a barrier to deploying AI models in “high-stakes financial or safety-critical settings, because we can’t fully set the limits on their behavior, and a small number of mistakes could be very harmful.” In decision-making that affects humans directly, like medical diagnosis or mortgage assessments, legal\nregulations\nrequire AI to explain its decisions.\nImagine a financial institution using a large language model (LLM) for fraud detection — interpretability could mean explaining a denied loan application to a customer as required by law. Or a manufacturing firm optimizing supply chains — understanding why an AI suggests a particular supplier could unlock efficiencies and prevent unforeseen bottlenecks.\nBecause of this, Amodei explains, “Anthropic is doubling down on interpretability, and we have a goal of getting to ‘interpretability can reliably detect most model problems’ by 2027.”\nTo that end, Anthropic recently participated in a $50 million\ninvestment\nin\nGoodfire\n, an AI research lab making breakthrough progress on AI “brain scans.” Their model inspection platform, Ember, is an agnostic tool that identifies learned concepts within models and lets users manipulate them. In a recent\ndemo\n, the company showed how Ember can recognize individual visual concepts within an image generation AI and then let users\npaint\nthese concepts on a canvas to generate new images that follow the user’s design.\nAnthropic’s investment in Ember hints at the fact that developing interpretable models is difficult enough that Anthropic does not have the manpower to achieve interpretability on their own. Creative interpretable models requires new toolchains and skilled developers to build them\nBroader context: An AI researcher’s perspective\nTo break down Amodei’s perspective and add much-needed context, VentureBeat interviewed Kapoor an AI safety researcher at Princeton. Kapoor co-authored the book\nAI Snake Oil\n, a critical examination of exaggerated claims surrounding the capabilities of leading AI models. He is also a co-author of “\nAI as Normal Technology\n,” in which he advocates for treating AI as a standard, transformational tool like the internet or electricity, and promotes a realistic perspective on its integration into everyday systems.\nKapoor doesn’t dispute that interpretability is valuable. However, he’s skeptical of treating it as the central pillar of AI alignment. “It’s not a silver bullet,” Kapoor told VentureBeat. Many of the most effective safety techniques, such as post-response filtering, don’t require opening up the model at all, he said.\nHe also warns against what researchers call the “fallacy of inscrutability” — the idea that if we don’t fully understand a system’s internals, we can’t use or regulate it responsibly. In practice, full transparency isn’t how most technologies are evaluated. What matters is whether a system performs reliably under real conditions.\nThis isn’t the first time Amodei has warned about the risks of AI outpacing our understanding. In his October 2024\npost\n, “Machines of Loving Grace,” he sketched out a vision of increasingly capable models that could take meaningful real-world actions (and maybe double our lifespans).\nAccording to Kapoor, there’s an important distinction to be made here between a model’s\ncapability\nand its\npower\n. Model capabilities are undoubtedly increasing rapidly, and they may soon develop enough intelligence to find solutions for many complex problems challenging humanity today. But a model is only as powerful as the interfaces we provide it to interact with the real world, including where and how models are deployed.\nAmodei has separately argued that the U.S. should maintain a lead in AI development, in part through\nexport controls\nthat limit access to powerful models. The idea is that authoritarian governments might use frontier AI systems irresponsibly — or seize the geopolitical and economic edge that comes with deploying them first.\nFor Kapoor, “Even the biggest proponents of export controls agree that it will give us at most a year or two.” He thinks we should treat AI as a “\nnormal technology\n” like electricity or the internet. While revolutionary, it took decades for both technologies to be fully realized throughout society. Kapoor thinks it’s the same for AI: The best way to maintain geopolitical edge is to focus on the “long game” of transforming industries to use AI effectively.\nOthers critiquing Amodei\nKapoor isn’t the only one critiquing Amodei’s stance. Last week at VivaTech in Paris, Jansen Huang, CEO of Nvidia,\ndeclared his disagreement\nwith Amodei’s views. Huang questioned whether the authority to develop AI should be limited to a few powerful entities like Anthropic. He said: “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe.”\nIn response, Anthropic\nstated\n: “Dario has never claimed that ‘only Anthropic’ can build safe and powerful AI. As the public record will show, Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers (including Anthropic) so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks and can prepare accordingly.”\nIt’s also worth noting that Anthropic isn’t alone in its pursuit of interpretability: Google’s DeepMind interpretability team, led by Neel Nanda, has also made\nserious contributions\nto interpretability research.\nUltimately, top AI labs and researchers are providing strong evidence that interpretability could be a key differentiator in the competitive AI market. Enterprises that prioritize interpretability early may gain a significant competitive edge by building more trusted, compliant, and adaptable AI systems.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nGoogle\nmoved decisively to strengthen its position in the artificial intelligence arms race Monday, declaring its most powerful\nGemini 2.5 models\nready for enterprise production while unveiling a new ultra-efficient variant designed to undercut competitors on cost and speed.\nThe Alphabet subsidiary promoted two of its flagship AI models—\nGemini 2.5 Pro\nand\nGemini 2.5 Flash\n—from experimental preview status to\ngeneral availability\n, signaling the company’s confidence that the technology can handle mission-critical business applications. Google simultaneously introduced\nGemini 2.5 Flash-Lite\n, positioning it as the most cost-effective option in its model lineup for high-volume tasks.\nThe announcements represent Google’s most assertive challenge yet to\nOpenAI’s market leadership\n, offering enterprises a comprehensive suite of AI tools spanning from premium reasoning capabilities to budget-conscious automation. The move comes as businesses increasingly demand production-ready AI systems that can scale reliably across their operations.\nWhy Google finally moved its most powerful AI models from preview to production status\nGoogle’s decision to graduate these models from preview reflects mounting pressure to match OpenAI’s rapid deployment of consumer and enterprise AI tools. While OpenAI has dominated headlines with\nChatGPT\nand its\nGPT-4 family\n, Google has pursued a more cautious approach, extensively testing models before declaring them production-ready.\n“The momentum of the Gemini 2.5 era continues to build,” wrote Jason Gelman, Director of Product Management for Vertex AI, in a\nblog post\nannouncing the updates. The language suggests Google views this moment as pivotal in establishing its AI platform’s credibility among enterprise buyers.\nThe timing appears strategic. Google released these updates just weeks after\nOpenAI faced scrutiny\nover the safety and reliability of its latest models, creating an opening for Google to position itself as the more stable, enterprise-focused alternative.\nHow Gemini’s ‘thinking’ capabilities give enterprises more control over AI decision-making\nWhat distinguishes Google’s approach is its emphasis on “\nreasoning\n” or “\nthinking\n” capabilities — a technical architecture that allows models to process problems more deliberately before responding. Unlike traditional language models that generate responses immediately,\nGemini 2.5 models\ncan spend additional computational resources working through complex problems step-by-step.\nThis “thinking budget” gives developers unprecedented control over AI behavior. They can instruct models to think longer for complex reasoning tasks or respond quickly for simple queries, optimizing both accuracy and cost. The feature addresses a critical enterprise need: predictable AI behavior that can be tuned for specific business requirements.\nGemini 2.5 Pro\n, positioned as Google’s most capable model, excels at complex reasoning, advanced code generation, and multimodal understanding. It can process up to one million tokens of context—roughly equivalent to 750,000 words — enabling it to analyze entire codebases or lengthy documents in a single session.\nGemini 2.5 Flash\nstrikes a balance between capability and efficiency, designed for high-throughput enterprise tasks like large-scale document summarization and responsive chat applications. The newly introduced Flash-Lite variant sacrifices some intelligence for dramatic cost savings, targeting use cases like classification and translation where speed and volume matter more than sophisticated reasoning.\nMajor companies like Snap and SmartBear are already using Gemini 2.5 in mission-critical applications\nSeveral major companies have already integrated these models into production systems, suggesting Google’s confidence in their stability isn’t misplaced.\nSnap Inc.\nuses\nGemini 2.5 Pro\nto power spatial intelligence features in its AR glasses, translating 2D image coordinates into 3D space for augmented reality applications.\nSmartBear\n, which provides software testing tools, leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash to translate manual test scripts into automated tests. “The ROI is multifaceted,” said Fitz Nowlan, the company’s VP of AI, describing how the technology accelerates testing velocity while reducing costs.\nHealthcare technology company\nConnective Health\nuses the models to extract vital medical information from complex free-text records — a task requiring both accuracy and reliability given the life-or-death nature of medical data. The company’s success with these applications suggests Google’s models have achieved the reliability threshold necessary for regulated industries.\nGoogle’s new AI pricing strategy targets both premium and budget-conscious enterprise customers\nGoogle’s pricing decisions signal its determination to compete aggressively across market segments. The company raised prices for\nGemini 2.5 Flash\ninput tokens from $0.15 to $0.30 per million tokens while reducing output token costs from $3.50 to $2.50 per million tokens. This restructuring benefits applications that generate lengthy responses — a common enterprise use case.\nMore significantly, Google eliminated the previous distinction between “thinking” and “non-thinking” pricing that had confused developers. The simplified pricing structure removes a barrier to adoption while making cost prediction easier for enterprise buyers.\nFlash-Lite’s introduction at $0.10 per million input tokens and $0.40 per million output tokens creates a new bottom tier designed to capture price-sensitive workloads. This pricing positions Google to compete with smaller AI providers who have gained traction by offering basic models at extremely low costs.\nWhat Google’s three-tier model lineup means for the competitive AI landscape\nThe simultaneous release of three production-ready models across different performance tiers represents a sophisticated market segmentation strategy. Google appears to be borrowing from the traditional software industry playbook: offer good, better, and best options to capture customers across budget ranges while providing upgrade paths as needs evolve.\nThis approach contrasts sharply with OpenAI’s strategy of pushing users toward its most capable (and expensive) models. Google’s willingness to offer genuinely low-cost alternatives could disrupt the market’s pricing dynamics, particularly for high-volume applications where cost per interaction matters more than peak performance.\nThe technical capabilities also position Google advantageously for enterprise sales cycles. The million-token context length enables use cases—like analyzing entire legal contracts or processing comprehensive financial reports — that competing models cannot handle effectively. For large enterprises with complex document processing needs, this capability difference could prove decisive.\nHow Google’s enterprise-focused approach differs from OpenAI’s consumer-first strategy\nThese releases occur against the backdrop of intensifying AI competition across multiple fronts. While consumer attention focuses on chatbot interfaces, the real business value—and revenue potential—lies in enterprise applications that can automate complex workflows and augment human decision-making.\nGoogle’s emphasis on production readiness and enterprise features suggests the company has learned from earlier AI deployment challenges. Previous Google AI launches sometimes felt premature or disconnected from real business needs. The extensive preview period for Gemini 2.5 models, combined with early enterprise partnerships, indicates a more mature approach to product development.\nThe technical architecture choices also reflect lessons learned from the broader industry. The “thinking” capability addresses criticism that AI models make decisions too quickly, without sufficient consideration of complex factors. By making this reasoning process controllable and transparent, Google positions its models as more trustworthy for high-stakes business applications.\nWhat enterprises need to know about choosing between competing AI platforms\nGoogle’s aggressive positioning of the\nGemini 2.5 family\nsets up 2025 as a pivotal year for enterprise AI adoption. With production-ready models spanning performance and cost requirements, Google has eliminated many of the technical and economic barriers that previously limited enterprise AI deployment.\nThe real test will come as businesses integrate these tools into critical workflows. Early enterprise adopters report promising results, but broader market validation requires months of production use across diverse industries and applications.\nFor technical decision makers, Google’s announcement creates both opportunity and complexity. The range of model options enables more precise matching of capabilities to requirements, but also demands more sophisticated evaluation and deployment strategies. Organizations must now consider not just whether to adopt AI, but which specific models and configurations best serve their unique needs.\nThe stakes extend beyond individual company decisions. As AI becomes integral to business operations across industries, the choice of AI platform increasingly determines competitive advantage. Enterprise buyers face a critical inflection point: commit to a single AI provider’s ecosystem or maintain costly multi-vendor strategies as the technology matures.\nGoogle wants to become the enterprise standard for AI—a position that could prove extraordinarily valuable as AI adoption accelerates. The company that created the search engine now wants to create the intelligence engine that powers every business decision.\nAfter years of watching OpenAI capture headlines and market share, Google has finally stopped talking about the future of AI and started selling it.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
