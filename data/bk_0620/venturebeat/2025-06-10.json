The strike was mainly about the rights of video game voice actors when it comes to the use of their voices or likenesses when it comes to the game companies’ use of AI to reproduce actors in their games.\nScreen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and the signatory video game companies have reached an agreement. The strike has been going on since July 26, 2024.\nThe companies include Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Epic Games Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc.\nThey have reached a tentative agreement on terms for the Interactive Media Contract, subject to review and approval by the national board and ratification by the membership in the coming weeks. Specific details of the agreement will be released with the ratification materials.\nIt is expected that the terms of a strike suspension agreement will be finalized with employers soon. Until such agreement is reached, however, SAG-AFTRA members will remain on strike against these employers.\nSAG-AFTRA National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a statement, “Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike.”\nHe added, “Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains. Thank you, Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Chair Sarah Elmaleh and Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez for your hard work and advocacy in pursuit of this contract.”\nSAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in a statement, “Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world’s most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation. Every contract is a work in progress and progress is the name of the game.”\nSAG-AFTRA members have been on strike against video game employers for 11 months. Prior to that, SAG-AFTRA members approved a video game strike authorization in September 2023 with a 98.32% yes vote.\nSAG-AFTRA represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, news writers, news editors, program hosts, puppeteers, recording artists, singers, stunt performers, voiceover artists and other entertainment and media professionals. SAG-AFTRA members are the faces and voices that entertain and inform America and the world.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

The new studio is working on\nInvincible VS\n, a new fighting game set in the franchise of the same name created by Robert Kirkman, Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley. Skybound revealed the new studio today, shortly after revealing the new title, which is set for launch sometime in 2026.\nAccording to Skybound, Quarter Up is a Los Angeles-based team with around 40+ members. The team has collective experience in studios such as Activision Blizzard, Riot Games, Naughty Dog, Netflix, Amazon Games and Double Helix, among others. The name is a reference to putting quarters in arcade machines in order to keep your gameplay going. Several members of the team have previous experience working on fighting games, in particular 2013’s Killer Instinct.\nMike Willette, Invincible VS executive producer, told GamesBeat in an interview, “Quarter Up is the first in-house game development studio at Skybound (second major in-house studio) dedicated to creating fighting games. We’re a hyper passionate team with extensive experience in competitive and combat-focused games. From the start, our goal and vision has always been to create experiences that make players jump out of their seats and feel heroic…feel like a badass… We’re a combat-focused studio and fighting games are where we want to leave our mark!”\nAs for how the studio started, Willette added, “A few of our key team members were part of the Double Helix Game’ Killer Instinct development team, which was eventually purchased by Amazon. We’ve always felt like we had unfinished business in the fighting game genre and we had dreamed too long about starting our own studio – we owed it to ourselves. I approached the team at Skybound about developing an Invincible fighting game; they believed and trusted in our vision and have been huge advocates in helping bring Invincible VS to life.”\nBringing the Invincible universe to bloody, violent life\nSkybound and Quarter Up revealed the game over the weekend during the Xbox Games Showcase for Summer Game Fest. Invincible VS is a 3v3 tag fighting game set in the Invincible universe and starring several of its familiar characters, including Mark “Invincible” Grayson, Atom Eve, Omni-Man and more. Quarter Up has not only recreated the comic book settings in the game, but also its gory, hyper-violent combat, as shown in the reveal trailer.\nChris Paulson, Skybound Games EVP and general manager, told GamesBeat in an interview, “We’re huge fans of Invincible, and each of us connects with the story and characters in different ways. We’re fortunate to work very closely with Robert Kirkman – he’s incredibly engaged and deeply involved in the process. We’ve had unprecedented access to teams behind the franchise across all mediums; the creators behind the hit TV series are leading charge on the story for Invincible VS. Capturing the franchise’s signature brutality and destruction is top priority; we want the game to reflect the true stakes of superhero combat — the kind fans already know and love.”\nPaulson also added in a separate statement, “The roster of talent at Quarter Up proves there’s no better studio to bring this bold project to life. This team carries a deep legacy in fighting games, and Invincible was the perfect title for in-house development by their fearless and confident crew. We’re thrilled that Mike and the team are part of Skybound and we can’t wait to see our vision come to life — on this game and beyond.”\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nApple\n‘s\nmachine learning research\nteam has developed a breakthrough AI system for generating high-resolution images that could challenge the dominance of diffusion models, the technology powering popular image generators like\nDALL-E\nand\nMidjourney\n.\nThe advancement, detailed in a research paper published last week, introduces “\nSTARFlow\n,” a system developed by Apple researchers in collaboration with academic partners that combines normalizing flows with autoregressive transformers to achieve what the team calls “competitive performance” with state-of-the-art diffusion models.\nThe breakthrough comes at a critical moment for Apple, which has faced\nmounting criticism\nover its struggles with artificial intelligence. At Monday’s\nWorldwide Developers Conference\n, the company unveiled only\nmodest AI updates\nto its\nApple Intelligence\nplatform, highlighting the competitive pressure facing a company that many view as falling behind in the AI arms race.\n“To our knowledge, this work is the first successful demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and resolution,” wrote the research team, which includes Apple machine learning researchers Jiatao Gu, Joshua M. Susskind, and Shuangfei Zhai, along with academic collaborators from institutions including\nThe University of California, Berkeley\nand\nGeorgia Tech\n.\nHow Apple is fighting back against OpenAI and Google in the AI wars\nThe\nSTARFlow\nresearch represents Apple’s broader effort to develop distinctive AI capabilities that could differentiate its products from competitors. While companies like\nGoogle\nand\nOpenAI\nhave dominated headlines with their generative AI advances, Apple has been working on alternative approaches that could offer unique advantages.\nThe research team tackled a fundamental challenge in AI image generation: scaling normalizing flows to work effectively with high-resolution images. Normalizing flows, a type of generative model that learns to transform simple distributions into complex ones, have traditionally been overshadowed by diffusion models and generative adversarial networks in image synthesis applications.\n“STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion models in sample quality,” the researchers wrote, demonstrating the system’s versatility across different types of image synthesis challenges.\nInside the mathematical breakthrough that powers Apple’s new AI system\nApple’s research team introduced several key innovations to overcome the limitations of existing normalizing flow approaches. The system employs what researchers call a “deep-shallow design,” using “a deep Transformer block [that] captures most of the model representational capacity, complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally efficient yet substantially beneficial.”\nThe breakthrough also involves operating in the “latent space of pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level modeling,” according to the paper. This approach allows the model to work with compressed representations of images rather than raw pixel data, significantly improving efficiency.\nUnlike diffusion models, which rely on iterative denoising processes,\nSTARFlow\nmaintains the mathematical properties of normalizing flows, enabling “exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.”\nWhat STARFlow means for Apple’s future iPhone and Mac products\nThe research arrives as Apple faces increasing pressure to demonstrate meaningful progress in artificial intelligence. A recent\nBloomberg analysis\nhighlighted how Apple Intelligence and Siri have struggled to compete with rivals. Apple’s modest announcements at WWDC this week underscored the company’s challenges in the AI space.\nFor Apple, STARFlow’s exact likelihood training could offer advantages in applications requiring precise control over generated content or in scenarios where understanding model uncertainty is critical for decision-making — potentially valuable for enterprise applications and on-device AI capabilities that Apple has emphasized.\nThe research demonstrates that alternative approaches to diffusion models can achieve comparable results, potentially opening new avenues for innovation that could play to Apple’s strengths in hardware-software integration and on-device processing.\nWhy Apple is betting on university partnerships to solve its AI problem\nThe research exemplifies Apple’s strategy of collaborating with leading academic institutions to advance its AI capabilities. Co-author\nTianrong Chen\n, a doctoral student at Georgia Tech who interned with Apple’s machine learning research team, brings expertise in stochastic optimal control and generative modeling.\nThe collaboration also includes\nRuixiang Zhang\nfrom U.C. Berkeley’s mathematics department and Laurent Dinh, a machine learning researcher known for pioneering work on flow-based models at\nGoogle Brain\nand\nDeepMind\n.\n“Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow,” the researchers emphasized, distinguishing their approach from hybrid methods that sacrifice mathematical tractability for improved performance.\nThe\nfull research paper\nis available on\narXiv\n, providing technical details for researchers and engineers looking to build upon this work in the competitive field of generative AI. While STARFlow represents a significant technical achievement, the real test will be whether Apple can translate such research breakthroughs into the kind of consumer-facing AI features that have made competitors like ChatGPT household names. For a company that once revolutionized entire industries with products like the iPhone, the question isn’t whether Apple can innovate in AI — it’s whether they can do it fast enough.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The company made the announcement at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).\nApple has had efforts in gaming in the past. It created Game Center in 2010 as a hub for game activities and a place to organize your games. And in 2019 it debuted Apple Arcade, funding a lot of game developers to make games for its subscription game service.\nThere is a library tab for all your games. You can play with a controller, making it easy to move from one game to another. You can compare scores and achievements with friends, and bring friends in score-based showdowns via Challenges in games. For developers, Challenges are built on top of Game Center leaderboards. Single-player games can be turned into competitions where you can crown a winner and see scores in real time. There are more ways to rally a group.\n“It’s an all-in-one destination for games and playing with friends,” said Thai.\nThe Home tab shows the games info that is relevant to you. It has things like can’t-miss events and recommendations. It has an Apple Arcade tab and it shows you friends playing in Play Together.\nOn MacOS, the new game app is available and it can bring to your screen a new game overlay. MacOS Tahoe will introduce Metal 4 with frame interpolation, de-noising and more.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

Simply plug in the expansion card and start playing.\nPlayers can now choose from 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB external storage capacities for a streamlined gaming experience replicating the speed and performance of their Xbox Series X console’s internal storage.\nAvailability\nThe Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X is now available for $500 (4TB) and can be purchased through\nthis link\nand select retailers.\nFor more information, please reference the Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X Data Sheet or its Media Kit.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

The incubator is designed to accelerate high-potential Web3 projects and fast-track them by addressing the most common go-to-market challenges: user traction, technical scalability, and discovery, with projects launching as early as Q3 2025.\nDevelopers accepted into the program won’t be starting from scratch — they’ll be building on a production-ready, high-traffic network backed by household IP and Sony’s global infrastructure.\nSelected projects will receive exposure through Soneium’s official channels, including blog features, AMAs, livestream sessions, and marketing campaigns.\nNotably, successful participants will also receive official investment support through sessions with the\nSony Innovation Fund\n, an official partner of the program. This includes one-on-one mentoring, strategic advisory, and the potential for follow-on investment.\nBacked by strategic partnerships with Astar Network and Startale Cloud Services, the incubator also offers dedicated grant support and core technical infrastructure. A $60,000 grant pool is available for qualifying projects that integrate ASTR as a utility or payment mechanism.\n“This initiative reflects our vision to empower creators globally through blockchain technology,” said Ryohei Suzuki, director of Sony Block Solutions Labs, in a statement. “By lowering the barriers to entry for developers and helping them reach users faster, Soneium For All brings us closer to a more open, creator-powered internet.”\n“As part of our efforts under Astar Evolution, and following the success of the Astar Contribution Score Campaign on Soneium, joining the ‘Soneium For All’ incubator is a natural next step,” said Maarten Henskens, Head of Astar Foundation. “With over 40 projects already integrating ASTR on Soneium, we’re committed to support developers building innovative gaming and consumer dApps that expand ASTR’s utility and solidify its role as a core asset in the Soneium ecosystem.”\nApplications open today, June 9, with winners announced in late July and deployments starting shortly after. For more information about Soneium For All and its growing ecosystem of applications, visit\nhttps://soneium.org\n.\nSoneium, an Ethereum layer-2 developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs, is a versatile general-purpose blockchain platform that aims to evoke emotion, empower creativity, and realize the open internet that transcends boundaries. By transcending cultural differences and bringing together people with diverse values, Soneium reimagines how we interact with the internet, opening up a world of innovative applications that fill the world with emotion.\nA joint venture with Sony Group Corporation and Startale Labs Pte. Ltd. established to build a new network infrastructure using blockchain technology. The company announced the planning and development of blockchain in September 2023, and in August 2024, the company name was changed from Sony Network Communications Labs Pte.
