The current cost for DeepSeek’s API is\nFor those looking to run the model locally, DeepSeek has published detailed instructions on its GitHub repository. The company also encourages the community to provide feedback and questions through their service email.\nIndividual users can try it for free through\nDeepSeek’s website here\n, though you’ll need to provide a phone number or Google Account access to sign in.\nEnhanced reasoning and benchmark performance\nAt the core of the update are significant improvements in the model’s ability to handle challenging reasoning tasks.\nDeepSeek explains in its new model card on HuggingFace that these enhancements stem from leveraging increased computational resources and applying algorithmic optimizations in post-training. This approach has resulted in notable improvements across various benchmarks.\nIn the AIME 2025 test, for instance, DeepSeek-R1-0528’s accuracy jumped from 70% to 87.5%, indicating deeper reasoning processes that now average 23,000 tokens per question compared to 12,000 in the previous version.\nCoding performance also saw a boost, with accuracy on the LiveCodeBench dataset rising from 63.5% to 73.3%. On the demanding “Humanity’s Last Exam,” performance more than doubled, reaching 17.7% from 8.5%.\nThese advances put DeepSeek-R1-0528 closer to the performance of established models like\nOpenAI’s o3\nand\nGemini 2.5 Pro\n, according to internal evaluations — both of those models either have rate limits and/or require paid subscriptions to access.\nUX upgrades and new features\nBeyond performance improvements, DeepSeek-R1-0528 introduces several new features aimed at enhancing the user experience.\nThe update adds support for JSON output and function calling, features that should make it easier for developers to integrate the model’s capabilities into their applications and workflows.\nFront-end capabilities have also been refined, and DeepSeek says these changes will create a smoother, more efficient interaction for users.\nAdditionally, the model’s hallucination rate has been reduced, contributing to more reliable and consistent output.\nOne notable update is the introduction of system prompts. Unlike the previous version, which required a special token at the start of the output to activate “thinking” mode, this update removes that need, streamlining deployment for developers.\nSmaller variants for those with more limited compute budgets\nAlongside this release, DeepSeek has distilled its chain-of-thought reasoning into a smaller variant, DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, which should help those enterprise decision-makers and developers who don’t have the hardware necessary to run the full\nThis distilled version reportedly achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on tasks such as AIME 2024, outperforming Qwen3-8B by 10% and matching Qwen3-235B-thinking.\nAccording to\nModal\n, running an 8-billion-parameter large language model (LLM) in half-precision (FP16) requires approximately 16 GB of GPU memory, equating to about 2 GB per billion parameters.\nTherefore, a single high-end GPU with at least 16 GB of VRAM, such as the NVIDIA RTX 3090 or 4090, is sufficient to run an 8B LLM in FP16 precision. For further quantized models, GPUs with 8–12 GB of VRAM, like the RTX 3060, can be used.\nDeepSeek believes this distilled model will prove useful for academic research and industrial applications requiring smaller-scale models.\nInitial AI developer and influencer reactions\nThe update has already drawn attention and praise from developers and enthusiasts on social media.\nHaider aka “\n@slow_developer\n” shared on X that DeepSeek-R1-0528 “is just incredible at coding,” describing how it generated clean code and working tests for a word scoring system challenge, both of which ran perfectly on the first try. According to him, only o3 had previously managed to match that performance.\nMeanwhile,\nLisan al Gaib posted\nthat “DeepSeek is aiming for the king: o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro,” reflecting the consensus that the new update brings DeepSeek’s model closer to these top performers.\nAnother AI news and rumor influencer,\nChubby\n, commented that “DeepSeek was cooking!” and highlighted how the new version is nearly on par with o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.\nChubby even speculated that the last R1 update might indicate that DeepSeek is preparing to release its long-awaited and presumed “R2” frontier model soon, as well.\nLooking Ahead\nThe release of DeepSeek-R1-0528 underscores DeepSeek’s commitment to delivering high-performing, open-source models that prioritize reasoning and usability. By combining measurable benchmark gains with practical features and a permissive open-source license, DeepSeek-R1-0528 is positioned as a valuable tool for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts looking to harness the latest in language model capabilities.\nLet me know if you’d like to add any more quotes, adjust the tone further, or highlight additional elements!\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Though many issues with generative AI are solved there is still lots of room for improvement.\nTwo such issues are text-to-SQL query and AI inference. SQL is the query language used for databases and it has been around in various forms for over 50 years. Existing large language models (LLMs) have text-to-SQL capabilities that can help users to write SQL queries. Vendors including Google have introduced\nadvanced natural language SQL capabilities\n. Inference is also a mature capability with common technologies including Nvidia’s TensorRT being widely deployed.\nWhile enterprises have widely deployed both technologies, they still face unresolved issues that demand solutions. Existing text-to-SQL capabilities in LLMs can generate plausible-looking queries, however they often break when executed against real enterprise databases. When it comes to inference, speed and cost efficiency are always areas where every enterprise is looking to do better.\nThat’s where a pair of new open-source efforts from Snowflake are aiming to make a difference: Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 and Arctic Inference.\nSnowflake’s approach to AI research is all about the enterprise\nSnowflake AI Research is tackling the issues of text-to-SQL and inference optimization by fundamentally rethinking the optimization targets.\nInstead of chasing academic benchmarks, the team focused on what actually matters in enterprise deployment. One issue is making sure the system can adapt to real traffic patterns without forcing costly trade-offs. The other issue is understanding if the generated SQL actually execute correctly against real databases? The result is two breakthrough technologies that address persistent enterprise pain points rather than incremental research advances.\n“We want to deliver practical, real-world AI research that solves critical enterprise challenges,” Dwarak Rajagopal, VP of AI Engineering and Research at Snowflake told VentureBeat. “We want to push the boundaries of open source AI, making cutting edge research accessible and impactful.”\nWhy text-to-SQL isn’t a solved problem (yet) for enterprise AI and data\nMultiple LLMs have had the ability to generate SQL from basic natural language queries. So why bother to create yet another text-to-SQL model?\nSnowflake evaluated existing models to first see if in fact text-to-SQL was, or wasn’t, a solved issue.\n“Existing LLMs can generate SQL that looks fluent, but when queries get complex, they often fail,” Yuxiong He, Distinguished AI Software Engineer at Snowflake explained to VentureBeat. “The real world use cases often have massive schema, ambiguous input, nested logic, but the existing models just aren’t trained to actually address those issues and get the right answer,  they were just trained to mimic patterns.”\nHow execution-aligned reinforcement learning improves text-to-SQL\nArctic-Text2SQL-R1 addresses the challenges of text-to-SQL through a series of approach.\nIt uses execution-aligned reinforcement learning that trains models directly on what matters most: does the SQL execute correctly and return the right answer? This represents a fundamental shift from optimizing for syntactic similarity to optimizing for execution correctness.\n“Rather than optimizing for text similarity, we train the model directly on what we care about the most. Does a query run correctly and use that as a simple and stable reward?” she explained.\nThe Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 family achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. The training approach uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The GRPO approach uses a simple reward signal based on execution correctness.\nShift parallelism helps to improve open-source AI inference\nCurrent AI inference systems force organizations into a fundamental choice: optimize for responsiveness\nand fast generation, or optimize for cost efficiency through high throughput utilization of expensive GPU resources. This either-or decision stems from incompatible parallelization strategies that cannot coexist in a single deployment.\nArctic Inference solves this through Shift Parallelism. It’s a new approach that dynamically switches between parallelization strategies based on real-time traffic patterns while maintaining compatible memory layouts. The system uses tensor parallelism when traffic is low and shifts to Arctic Sequence Parallelism when batch sizes increase.\nThe technical breakthrough centers on Arctic Sequence Parallelism, which splits input sequences across GPUs to parallelize work within individual requests.\n“Arctic Inference makes AI inference up to two times more responsive than any open-source offering,” Samyam Rajbhandari, Principal AI Architect at Snowflake, told VentureBeat.\nFor enterprises, Arctic Inference will likely be particularly attractive as it can be deployed with the same approach that many organizations are already using for inference. Arctic Inference will likely attract enterprises because organizations can deploy it using their existing inference approaches.Arctic Inference deploys as an\nvLLM\nplugin. The vLLM technology is a widely used open-source inference server. As such it is able to maintain compatibility with existing Kubernetes and bare-metal workflows while automatically patching vLLM with performance optimizations. “\n“When you install Arctic inference and vLLM together, it just simply works out of the box, it doesn’t require you to change anything in your VLM workflow, except your model just runs faster,” Rajbhandari said.\nStrategic implications for enterprise AI\nFor enterprises looking to lead the way in AI deployment, these releases represent a maturation of enterprise AI infrastructure that prioritizes production deployment realities.\nThe text-to-SQL breakthrough particularly impacts enterprises struggling with business user adoption of data analytics tools. By training models on execution correctness rather than syntactic patterns, Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 addresses the critical gap between AI-generated queries that appear correct and those that actually produce reliable business insights. The impact of Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 for enterprises will likely take more time, as many organizations are likely to continue to rely on built-in tools inside of their database platform of choice.\nArctic Inference offers the promise of much better performance than any other open-source option, with an easy path to deployment too. For enterprises currently managing separate AI inference deployments for different performance requirements, Arctic Inference’s unified approach could significantly reduce infrastructure complexity and costs while improving performance across all metrics.\nAs open-source technologies, Snowflake’s efforts have the potential to benefit all enterprises that are looking to improve on challenges that aren’t yet entirely solved.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

This means advanced, secure, and personalized AI can run locally, without relying on cloud infrastructure. We hope this will radically expand what you can do with AI.”\nPreviously, models driving the next generation of AI economy—multimodal and reasoning systems—required massive data center processing power. Cloud dependency’s cost, latency, and security drawbacks made countless AI applications impossible.\nEN100 shatters these limitations. By fundamentally reshaping where AI inference happens, developers can now deploy sophisticated, secure, personalized applications locally.\nThis breakthrough enables organizations to rapidly integrate advanced capabilities into existing products—democratizing powerful AI technologies and bringing high-performance inference directly to end-users, the company said.\nEN100, the first of the EnCharge EN series of chips, features an optimized architecture that efficiently processes AI tasks while minimizing energy. Available in two form factors – M.2 for laptops and PCIe for workstations – EN100 is engineered to transform on-device capabilities:\n● M.2 for Laptops: Delivering up to 200+ TOPS of AI compute power in an 8.25W power envelope, EN100 M.2 enables sophisticated AI applications on laptops without compromising battery life or portability.\n● PCIe for Workstations: Featuring four NPUs reaching approximately 1 PetaOPS, the EN100 PCIe card delivers GPU-level compute capacity at a fraction of the cost and power consumption, making it ideal for professional AI applications utilizing complex models and large datasets.\nEnCharge AI’s comprehensive software suite delivers full platform support across the evolving model landscape with maximum efficiency. This purpose-built ecosystem combines specialized optimization tools, high-performance compilation, and extensive development resources—all supporting popular frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.\nCompared to competing solutions, EN100 demonstrates up to ~20x better performance per watt across various AI workloads. With up to 128GB of high-density LPDDR memory and bandwidth reaching 272 GB/s, EN100 efficiently handles sophisticated AI tasks, such as generative language models and real-time computer vision, that typically require specialized data center hardware. The programmability of EN100 ensures optimized performance of AI models today and the ability to adapt for the AI models of tomorrow.\n“The real magic of EN100 is that it makes transformative efficiency for AI inference easily accessible to our partners, which can be used to help them achieve their ambitious AI roadmaps,” says Ram Rangarajan, Senior Vice President of Product and Strategy at EnCharge AI. “For client platforms, EN100 can bring sophisticated AI capabilities on device, enabling a new generation of intelligent applications that are not only faster and more responsive but also more secure and personalized.”\nEarly adoption partners have already begun working closely with EnCharge to map out how EN100 will deliver transformative AI experiences, such as always-on multimodal AI agents and enhanced gaming applications that render realistic environments in real-time.\nWhile the first round of EN100’’s Early Access Program is currently full, interested developers and OEMs can sign up to learn more about the upcoming Round 2 Early Access Program, which provides a unique opportunity to gain a competitive advantage by being among the first to leverage EN100’s capabilities for commercial applications at www.encharge.ai/en100.\nCompetition\nEnCharge doesn’t directly compete with many of the big players, as we have a slightly different focus and strategy. Our approach prioritizes the rapidly growing AI PC and edge device market, where our energy efficiency advantage is most compelling, rather than competing directly in data center markets.\nThat said, EnCharge does have a few differentiators that make it uniquely competitive within the chip landscape. For one, EnCharge’s chip has dramatically higher energy efficiency (approximately 20 times greater) than the leading players. The chip can run the most advanced AI models using about as much energy as a light bulb, making it an extremely competitive offering for any use case that can’t be confined to a data center.\nSecondly, EnCharge’s analog in-memory computing approach makes its chips far more compute dense than conventional digital architectures, with roughly 30 TOPS/mm2 versus 3. This allows customers to pack significantly more AI processing power into the same physical space, something that’s particularly valuable for laptops, smartphones, and other portable devices where space is at a premium. OEMs can integrate powerful AI capabilities without compromising on device size, weight, or form factor, enabling them to create sleeker, more compact products while still delivering advanced AI features.\nOrigins\nEncharge AI has raised $144 million.\nIn March 2024, EnCharge partnered with Princeton University to secure an $18.6 million grant from DARPA Optimum Processing Technology Inside Memory Arrays (OPTIMA) program Optima is a $78 million effort to develop fast, power-efficient, and scalable compute-in-memory accelerators that can unlock new possibilities for commercial and defense-relevant AI workloads not achievable with current technology.\nEnCharge’s inspiration came from addressing a critical challenge in AI: the inability of traditional computing architectures to meet the needs of AI. The company was founded to solve the problem that, as AI models grow exponentially in size and complexity, traditional chip architectures (like GPUs) struggle to keep pace, leading to both memory and processing bottlenecks, as well as associated skyrocketing energy demands. (For example, training a single large language model can consume as much electricity as 130 U.S. households use in a year.)\nThe specific technical inspiration originated from the work of EnCharge ‘s founder, Naveen Verma, and his research at Princeton University in next generation computing architectures. He and his collaborators spent over seven years exploring a variety of innovative computing architectures, leading to a breakthrough in analog in-memory computing.\nThis approach aimed to significantly enhance energy efficiency for AI workloads while mitigating the noise and other challenges that had hindered past analog computing efforts. This technical achievement, proven and de-risked over multiple generations of silicon, was the basis for founding EnCharge AI to commercialize analog in-memory computing solutions for AI inference.\nEncharge AI launched in 2022, led by a team with semiconductor and AI system experience. The team spun out of Princeton University, with a focus on a robust and scalable analog in-memory AI inference chip and accompanying software.\nThe company was able to overcome previous hurdles to analog and in-memory chip architectures by leveraging precise metal-wire switch capacitors instead of noise-prone transistors. The result is a full-stack architecture that is up to 20 times more energy efficient than currently available or soon-to-be-available leading digital AI chip solutions.\nWith this tech, EnCharge is fundamentally changing how and where AI computation happens. Their technology dramatically reduces the energy requirements for AI computation, bringing advanced AI workloads out of the data center and onto laptops, workstations, and edge devices. By moving AI inference closer to where data is generated and used, EnCharge enables a new generation of AI-enabled devices and applications that were previously impossible due to energy, weight, or size constraints while improving security, latency, and cost.\nWhy it matters\nEncharge AI is striving to get rid of memory bottlenecks in AI computing.\nAs AI models have grown exponentially in size and complexity, their chip and associated energy demands have skyrocketed. Today, the vast majority of AI inference computation is accomplished with massive clusters of energy-intensive chips warehoused in cloud data centers. This creates cost, latency, and security barriers for applying AI to use cases that require on-device computation.\nOnly with transformative increases in compute efficiency will AI be able to break out of the data center and address on-device AI use-cases that are size, weight, and power constrained or have latency or privacy requirements that benefit from keeping data local. Lowering the cost and accessibility barriers of advanced AI can have dramatic downstream effects on a broad range of industries, from consumer electronics to aerospace and defense.\nThe reliance on data centers also present supply chain bottleneck risks. The AI-driven surge in demand for high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) alone could increase total demand for certain upstream components by 30% or more by 2026. However, a demand increase of about 20% or more has a high likelihood of upsetting the equilibrium and causing a chip shortage.
