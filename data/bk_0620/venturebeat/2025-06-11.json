As early-stage investments continue to shrink, investors grow increasingly discerning, and the M&A and exit environment remain muted, there are still bright spots: investment surged into back-end gaming infrastructure and AI-powered platforms, with standout deals like Bria’s and Beamable’s Series As.\nMeanwhile, leading platforms like Roblox and Discord doubled down on in-game advertising strategies, signaling a potential adtech renaissance. This report dives into the investment trends, macroeconomic headwinds, and key deals and players shaping the gaming sector. Overall, it was a mixed quarter.\nQ1 deal activity extends the current equilibrium\nQ1 activity in gaming investments\nGaming VC investment decreased slightly in Q1 2025 to $1.2 billion (-3% QoQ) across 134 deals\n(-5% QoQ). Excluding Disney’s outlier investment in Epic Games in Q3 2024, deal activity has largely stabilized since H1 2023, averaging $1.3 billion across 172 transactions per quarter, albeit with pressure to the downside on deal volume.\nDeal count in Q1 was the lowest quarterly figure since Q2 2019, underscoring that investors are increasingly discerning as the industry awaits the next platform shift, focusing on distribution innovation in the interim while grappling with the lack of breakout hits from exuberant funding between 2021 and 2022. Exit pathways remain largely blocked, with closed VC and PE exits generating $128 million in disclosed value across 13 deals.\nTariff headwinds shift\nThe quarterly breakdown of game deals.\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs announced in April came after months of speculation about the ultimate depth and breadth of levies expected from the administration. Global gaming hubs Vietnam, China, and Japan were ensnared, as was the rest of the world, roiling markets in uncertainty and driving the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, upward.\nThe worst of the impact was avoided due to the announcement of delays and deals. Gaming’s primary exposure to the tariffs is in hardware and peripheral components, which amount to a $40 billion market.\nOne degree removed, toymakers and intellectual property (IP) holders, like Mattel and Hasbro, saw their stock prices plunge following these announcements. Platforms that have leaned into digitization—for example, Microsoft’s Game Pass for Xbox and Hasbro’s licensing of Monopoly IP—continue to have a hedge against exogenous shocks, like tariffs, by lessening their dependence on global supply chains, demand volatility, and manufacturing.\nAfter revealing specs for the Switch 2, priced at a higher-than-anticipated $450, Nintendo then delayed preorders in the US and now faces a diminished sales outlook in the near term. Hardware manufacturers that shipped the product throughout the first Trump administration do have some experience shifting supply chains, but the geopolitical climate has increased in complexity.\nConsumer groups, like the Consumer Technology Association and Entertainment Software Association, have voiced their opposition throughout the past five months, warning that game consoles could become 40% more expensive. An emergent risk is the threat of tariffs targeting digital products like movies and television shows made outside of the U.S., PitchBook said.\nOne degree removed are video games, which have a global development footprint and a fraught regulatory relationship to begin with, as evidenced by China’s close grip on game license approvals. Though these tariffs represent a nonzero risk, we view them as less likely compared with levies on electronics and hardware, PitchBook said.\nAmong consumers, market bifurcation remains pronounced\nPitchBook looks at the big deals.\nAggregate retail sales undulated in Q1, signaling potential weakness in consumer demand. Sales sputtered in January but jumped in March due to anticipation of future price increases. The economy’s underlying bifurcation remains pronounced: Top-decile earners accounted for nearly half of domestic spending, while spending totals decline across all other brackets.\nIn gaming, this translates to companies marketing premium product bundles across hardware and software. Preorders of the Switch 2 numbered in the millions, despite a $450 price tag, while flagship titles\nlike Mario Kart World now cost $80. PlayStation sales in Q1 were buoyed by the $700 PlayStation 5 Pro, and the industry continues to speculate about Grand Theft Auto VI’s price point, which may well be augmented by its inclusion in a premium bundle.\nEarly investment activity faces continued pressure, late-stage activity stabilizes\nPre-seed/seed VC activity in gaming continues to face downward pressure. Q1 2025 produced 44 deals, the lowest count since Q3 2018. As a portion of all gaming VC activity, pre-seed/seed activity bottomed at 25.7% of rounds in Q1 2024, but the absolute count of deals continues to shrink and currently sits in the low-30% range. Early-stage deal volume continues to undulate.\nConversely, late-stage and venture growth activity has trended upward from 17.6% at the start of\n2022 to nearly 33% at the start of 2025.\nThe rationale for these trajectories is varied. Over the past three to five years, fewer investments have been made across venture, adversely affecting gaming downstream. As the quality bar and opportunity cost of these transactions increases with the zero-interest-rate period further in the rearview mirror, fewer deals close. As we indicated in our 2025 Consumer Technology Outlook, fewer funds are actively backing gaming startups as emergent trends, like Web3 and the Metaverse, decelerate and few success stories have emerged from previous fundraising cycles.\nCompetition for user attention is as intense as ever, with short-form video on social media eating into user attention, leading games ossifying their position at the top of the charts across mediums, and the overall supply of content coming at a pace inconsistent with consumer demand. And yet, dry powder certainly exists.\nSeveral investors closed new funds in recent months: Arcadia Gaming Advisors announced an inaugural fund for $100 million, led by Tripledot Studios co-founder Akin Babayigit; Play Ventures raised $140 million for its third fund in November; Laton Ventures closed a $50 million fund in February; and Kameha Ventures announced a debut $25 million gametech fund in March. However, for many investors, the lack of breakout hits from well-funded companies has eroded confidence in the industry.\nThose who successfully secured early-stage financing may find themselves re-entering a fundraising cycle with a completed product but no commercial traction, which intersects with this investor skepticism.\nExit pathways underwhelm\nPitchBook’s summary of Q1 game deals.\nPitchBook’s 2025 US Venture Capital Outlook noted that exit activity is top-heavy, concentrated\namong only two deals—CoreWeave’s IPO and Google’s acquisition of Wiz—which accounted for\nan outsized portion of liquidity. While several high-visibility startups have filed for IPO, tariff and\nmacroeconomic uncertainty clouded the outlook throughout Q1 as platforms such as Klarna,\nStubHub, and Discord delayed their processes, PitchBook said.\nThe gaming industry reflects these trends to an exaggerated extent. Quarterly exit activity was subdued: 13 deals produced $128 million in disclosed exit value. M&A activity fared slightly better, producing 31 acquisitions and $2.3 billion, though both figures are pacing below 2024’s $15.3 billion across 118 deals. When recently announced deals finally close, the top-line figures will also be top-heavy, counting deals such as Scopely’s purchase of Niantic for $3.5 billion and Discord’s eventual IPO. Only three other companies in our curated vertical are currently in IPO registration.\nLooking ahead, few gaming unicorns exist, which mitigates the demand for liquidity from the unicorn backlog across venture. Incumbents are moving to fortify balance sheets and focus on distribution innovation as the current console cycle ages. While select strategics signal a willingness to be acquisitive, such as Savvy Games Group’s comments regarding the PC/console market, this disposition is the exception, not the norm.\nGametech activity is buoyed by AI\nWe previously suggested the delta between content and backend software-as-a-service (SaaS) deals would narrow. While we fully expect content to be the industry’s growth driver, investor interest in SaaS continues to hold. On a trailing 12-month basis, development startups accounted for 164 transactions totaling $2.5 billion in deal value compared with 313 deals and $2 billion for content startups (excluding the Disney-Epic Games deal and Infinite Reality’s $3 billion later-stage deal in Q1 2025).\nThis interest is propelled by rapidly improving generative AI and large language models that investors hope will reign in spiraling AAA development costs, promote SaaS-based business models instead of the boom-or-bust nature of game development, and offer exposure to the broader game industry’s nearly $200 billion market.\nNotable Q1 rounds include GPU platform Ubitus K.K. raising $29.5 million, digital-agent platform Altera’s $31 million raise, game-server platform Beamable’s $13.5 million Series A, and visual-generation platform Bria’s $40 million Series, PitchBook said.\nSeeking marginal gains in monetization, the industry looks to advertising tech (adtech)\nWhile video game advertising spending is pushing $50 billion, this ranks well below advertising\nspending for categories like social media or retail media and concentrates in the mobile gaming\necosystem.6 Historically, advertising technology in games has been constrained by several\nfactors, including nonstandardized ad units, complexity in measuring the commercial impact of\nin-game ad units, and few programmatic advertising opportunities. In Q1, several announcements\nunderscored this strategic imperative.\nRoblox announced a partnership with Alphabet to add rewarded video ads, and Discord announced Video Quests on its mobile app (with a pilot coming in the summer), similarly leaning into rewarded video ads. In our Q1 analyst note on gametech, several of the largest YoY increases in PitchBook’s Exit Predictor outcomes were for adtech companies, including InMobi and Superfine.\nPitchBook views this development as both difficult and inevitable. The industry has untapped potential for advertisers that will be addressed over time as gaming continues to expand its reach and visibility. However, the problems of ad units and their measurement remain unsolved and will thus mitigate adtech’s near-term reach until solutions are found, PitchBook said.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nMajor AI providers like\nOpenAI\n,\nGoogle\n,\nxAI\nand others have all launched various AI agents that conduct exhaustive or “deep” research across the web on behalf of users, spending minutes at a time to compile extensively cited white papers and reports that, in their best case versions, are ready to be circulated to colleagues, customers and business partners without any human editing or reworking.\nBut they all have a significant limitation out-of-the-box: they are only able to search the web and the many public facing websites on it — not any of the enterprise customer’s\ninternal\ndatabases and knowledge graphs. Unless, of course, the enterprise or their consultants take the time to build a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipeline using something like\nOpenAI’s Responses API\n, but this would require a fair bit of time, expense, and developer expertise to set up.\nBut now\nAlphaSense\n, an early AI platform for market intelligence, is trying to do enterprises — particularly those in financial services and large enterprises (it\ncounts 85% of the S&P 100 as its customers\n) — one better.\nToday the company announced its own “Deep Research,”\nan autonomous AI agent designed to automate complex research workflows that extends across the web, AlphaSense’s catalog of continuously updated, non-public proprietary data sources such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley research reports, and the enterprise customers’ own data (whatever they hook the platform up to, it’s their choice).\nNow available to all AlphaSense users, the tool helps generate detailed analytical outputs in a fraction of the time traditional methods require.\n“Deep Research is our first autonomous agent that conducts research in the platform on behalf of the user—reducing tasks that once took days or weeks to just minutes,” said Chris Ackerson, Senior Vice President of Product at AlphaSense, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat.\nUnderlying model architecture and performance optimization\nTo power its AI tools — including Deep Research — AlphaSense relies on a flexible architecture built around a dynamic suite of large language models.\nRather than committing to a single provider, the company selects models based on performance benchmarks, use case fit, and ongoing developments in the LLM ecosystem.\nCurrently, AlphaSense draws on three primary model families: Anthropic, accessed via AWS Bedrock, for advanced reasoning and agentic workflows; Google Gemini, valued for its balanced performance and ability to handle long-context prompts; and Meta’s Llama models, integrated through a partnership with AI hardware startup\nCerebras\n.\nThrough that collaboration, AlphaSense uses Cerebras Inference running on WSE-3 (Wafer-Scale Engine) hardware, optimizing inference speed and efficiency for high-volume tasks. This multi-model strategy enables the platform to deliver consistently high-quality outputs across a range of complex research scenarios.\nNew AI agent aims to replicate the work of a skilled analyst team with speed and high accuracy\nAckerson emphasized the tool’s unique combination of speed, depth, and transparency.\n“To reduce hallucinations, we ground every AI-generated insight in source content, and users can trace any output directly to the exact sentence in the original document,” he said.\nThis granular traceability is aimed at building trust among business users, many of whom rely on AlphaSense for high-stakes decisions in volatile markets.\nEvery report generated by Deep Research includes clickable citations to underlying content, enabling both verification and deeper follow-up.\nBuilding on a decade of AI development\nAlphaSense’s launch of Deep Research marks the latest step in a multi-year evolution of its AI offerings. “From the founding of the company, we’ve been leveraging AI to support financial and corporate professionals in the research process, starting with better search to eliminate blind spots and control-F nightmares,” Ackerson said.\nHe described the company’s path as one of continuous improvement: “As AI improved, we moved from basic information discovery to true analysis—automating more of the workflow, always directed by the user.”\nAlphaSense has introduced several AI tools over the past few years. “We’ve launched tools like Generative Search for fast Q&A across all AlphaSense content, Generative Grid to analyze documents side by side, and now Deep Research for long-form synthesis across hundreds of documents,” he added.\nUse cases: from M&A analysis to executive briefings\nDeep Research is designed to support a range of high-value workflows. These include generating company and industry primers, screening for M&A opportunities, and preparing detailed board or client briefings. Users can issue natural language prompts, and the agent returns tailored outputs complete with supporting rationale and source links.\nProprietary data and internal integration set it apart\nOne of AlphaSense’s primary advantages lies in its proprietary content library. “AlphaSense aggregates over 500 million premium and proprietary documents, including exclusive content like sell-side research and expert call interviews—data you can’t find on the public web,” Ackerson explained.\nThe platform also supports integration of clients’ internal documentation, creating a blended research environment. “We allow customers to integrate their own institutional knowledge into AlphaSense, making internal data more powerful when combined with our premium content,” he said.\nThis means firms can feed internal reports, slide decks, or notes into the system and have them analyzed alongside external market data for deeper contextual understanding.\nCommitment to continuous information updates and a security focus\nAll data sources in AlphaSense are continuously updated. “All of our content sets are growing—hundreds of thousands of documents added daily, thousands of expert calls every month, and continuous licensing of new high-value sources,” Ackerson said.\nAlphaSense also places significant emphasis on enterprise security. “We’ve built a secure, enterprise-grade system that meets the requirements of the most regulated firms. Clients retain control of their data, with full encryption and permissions management,” Ackerson noted.\nDeployment options are designed to be flexible. “We offer both multi-tenant and single-tenant deployments, including a private cloud option where the software runs entirely within the client’s infrastructure,” he said.\nGrowing precision, custom enterprise AI demand\nThe launch of Deep Research responds to a broader enterprise trend toward intelligent automation. According to a Gartner prediction cited by AlphaSense, 50% of business decisions will be augmented or automated by AI agents by 2027.\nAckerson believes AlphaSense’s long-standing commitment to AI gives it an edge in meeting these needs. “Our approach has always been to ride the wave of better AI to deliver more value. In the last two years, we’ve seen a hockey stick in model capability—now they’re not just organizing content, but reasoning over it,” he said.\nA new tool for a complex business environment\nWith Deep Research, AlphaSense continues its push to simplify the work of professionals operating in fast-moving and data-dense environments. By combining high-quality proprietary content, customizable integrations, and AI-generated synthesis, the platform aims to deliver strategic clarity at speed and scale.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

It’s also fostering re-engagement through challenges that bring players together with their friends.\nThe backstory\nTim Cook, CEO of Apple, at WWDC 2025.\nIn 2021, Apple retired the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), which hurt discovery and user acquisition for games. It also fought a 4.5 year antitrust legal battle with Epic Games over its app store practices. And now Apple is reviving its dev-focused Game Center tech and its consumer-focused Apple Games app, and so it is finally doing something that should improve discovery for game developers in a big way.\nTim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, led a crusade against Apple and its failure to earn the 30% “tax” that it collected on every single App Store transaction in games. By contrast, Epic Games charged only 12% for many games and as little as 5% for games where Epic simply handled transactions.\nApple reduced the 30% fees along the way for games . But it resisted the effort to force it to cut fees until the European Union came in with litigation and Epic won a key point in the U.S. antitrust case, where a judge ruled Apple could not charge “junk fees” and could not block devs from advertising in their apps lower prices than the App Store on their own web shops.\nApple Games app\nApple Games app will connect you with friends through games.\nApple hasn’t said this yet, but if the Apple Games app is successful, then it can claim that it is taking those fees and reinvesting them in its platform to make it easier for developers to earn more money through better game discovery, better recommendations, social interaction with friends and re-engagement with older games through challenges with friends. Perhaps it’s not adding up to 30% in value, but it is an example of Apple giving back to its key game developers.\nOf course, there are makers of social apps for game discovery that may not be feeling so good right now, but we’ll see if Apple has a way to reward them as well.\nApple Games is a new all-in-one destination for games and playing with friends on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\nAt Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple unveiled Apple Games, a destination designed to help players jump back into the games they love, find their next favorite, and have more fun with friends, turning even single-player games into shared experiences. The Apple Games app has five tabs: Home, Apple Arcade, Play Together, Library and Search.\nThe games app has the usual list of top apps lists that you can find in the app store. But the library brings all of your games together in one place, and it also exposes you to a new list of the “top played games.” This isn’t like the “most downloaded” game list, which can include a lot of games you don’t play much. Rather, this “top played” list has the games that people around the world are playing the most.\nThat can help overcome some obstacles to discovery because it’s based on play, rather than things like “the list of games that advertise the most” or the “games that have the biggest brands” or “the games that people download and play and then never play again.”\nThe Games app makes it easier than ever for players to enjoy all their games in one convenient place and see what’s happening across their games, including major events and updates, so they never miss a moment.\nPlayers can see what’s new in their games, and explore can’t-miss events and updates in the Apple Games app, whether holding their iPhone vertically or horizontally.\nA briefing on Apple Games app\nThe Apple Games app tracks your game record.\nIn a more detailed session, I learned a bit more detail. The Home tab is where you can get more out of your games that you’re playing, and discover your next favorite based on what you are playing. So the first thing you see when you open up this app. You can see here if one of your friends beat you in a Challenge on the leaderboard for a game. You could also see a notification of a new character in a game that you’re playing.\nSome of these functions are duplicated in third-party apps elsewhere — those aimed at discovery.\nThere is a section dubbed “continue playing,” where it shows all the games you have been playing recently. You can jump right back into them, just like you see on streaming services like Netflix for shows. You can also see games you have recently downloaded so you don’t lose track of them. Another section below that shows the games that your friends are playing, which is also a great way to discover new games.\nIf you subscribe to Apple Arcade, you will see the games that are available, including new trending titles or titles that you might like. The top played games is based on the titles that have been played the most.\nThe library tab shows games that are currently installed on the device, as well as the games that you have downloaded throughout your history and are available for re-downloading.\nGame Center was introduced to consumers in 2010 and it was available for them to use until 2016. After that, it was removed as an app, but its features were still available for developers to use. The developers could add features like leaderboards that were hosted within the system still. Game Center is a social gaming framework that lets games talk to the operating system, allowing them to get discovered. You can see the achievements that you hit in games, if Game Center has been implemented by the game dev.\nAnd in that sense, Apple is still making use of Game Center and so it is not currently planning to retire Game Center.\nThe Play Together tab lets players play games with their friends and form groups. You can see your history of playing games together with particular friends. It makes it really easy to play with them. You can tap on a friend and play. All developers in the store can implement these features, and tens of thousands of developers are using the Game Center features.\nYou can also issue Challenges to friends in single-player games, where you play it, get a score and then challenge your friend to beat that score as they play asynchronously — sometime in the next 24 hours.\nA game developer set up a Challenge and played one of his games and then invited another friend to beat that score. The friend gets a notification of the Challenge and then plays the game. You can add as many as 16 people into a challenge, whether they are friends or others you have played with.\nOver the past nine years since Game Center disappeared as an app, Apple has been adding features like leaderboards. When players open the Apple Games app, they will need to create a Game Center account, then add their friends and set their privacy settings. You can control who you share your game info with.\nI can see a little room for improvement. Perhaps there could be something like a most discovered new game, or something like that which surfaces a a small game that is catching on well. And I would like to know more about how much info is shared with all developers versus key partners.\nDeveloper comments\nGlib Platonov, CEO of Doghowl Games, maker of Thronefall.\n“As my friends have grown up and moved away, I miss hearing about what they’re playing on their phones, and the Games app is a great way I can get a window back into their gaming worlds. The app also helps us seamlessly integrate and extend all of the social community features we’ve built into Puzzmo directly into the center of our player’s existing daily play routine,” said Zach Gage, indie developer and cofounder of Puzzmo, in a statement.\n“The introduction of challenges and a new social layer marks a major leap forward for both developers and players. While creators stay focused on gameplay, these features bring people together in just a few taps, effortlessly deepening player engagement — especially important for games like Thronefall,” said Glib Platonov, cofounder of Doghowl Games, in a statement.\n“The Games app is going to be a game changer for playing on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The app makes it easy for us to create moments just for groups of friends. The new challenges feature works great and feels natural for our games on Apple Arcade, including our latest release, What the Clash?, and we’ve been having a lot of fun with it,” said Tim Garbos, creative director and cofounder of Triband, in a statement.\nGarbos was in my demo of the Apple Games app. Garbos said in a group briefing that he was really excited about the new games app, especially the Play Together feature.\nAnother dev who wasn’t part of the Apple event was Juhana Kotilainen, formerly of Rovio. He said, “It’s great for more games discovery and engagement. More venues and impressions give more downloads and support for game developers.”\n“It was a very important thing to create,” said Platonov of Doghowl Games, developer of Thronefall, a strategy game that debuted on Steam last year and has been out on iOS for a couple of weeks. It has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times and it has a 96% positive rating.\n“The Apple Games app is available in beta and it’s super easy to use,” Platonov said. “It has things like Challenges, leaderboards, friends, achievements and more. Game Center is built into the app, but it is no longer its own app like it used to be. On the server side, everything is the same. But the front end has changed.”\nIn terms of other social activities, there are apps such as Reddit, Discord, TikTok and Facebook. But Platonov noted, “I would say that the biggest thing is that the players no longer needs to jump in and (figure things out). The experience is very smooth. When you receive a challenge, you just accept it. You go through the app and you start playing right away. Your high score will be very easy to access and send to your friend. It’s less friction. That’s exactly what we need.”\nApple Arcade\nSneaky Sasquatch is a top game on Apple Arcade.\nThe Games app is also the best way to experience Apple Arcade, Apple’s subscription service with more than 200 award-winning and highly rated games for the whole family, including Hello Kitty Island Adventure, Sneaky Sasquatch, and Mini Motorways.\nApple Games is the best place to experience Apple Arcade and access over 200 award-winning and highly rated games. They’re all curated.\nLaunch Favorite Games, Discover New Ones\nYou can easily find games that you have downloaded.\nThe Games app allows players to see all the games they have ever downloaded from the App Store for their iPhone and iPad, and brings together all the games they have on Mac. Players can see every game they have ever downloaded from the App Store, and dive back in where they left off.\nThey can connect any compatible game controller for easy navigation around the app and to launch right into their games. Players can explore personalized recommendations based on games they’ve played, games their friends are playing, and games supporting Game Center features, that can be played together.\nPlayers can connect any compatible game controller for easy navigation around the Apple Games app.\nEditorial collections also appear in the app to help players find new games, including some of the most exciting games on the App Store, such as Balatro, Crashlands 2, and Dredge. If they are an Apple Arcade subscriber, players will see curated collections of the best games included in the catalog that help them get the most out of their subscription.\nPlay Together: Challenges and recommendations\nYou can play Apple Games titles with a controller if you like.\nFrom the Home tab in Apple Games, players can get game recommendations based on play activity. Players now have all their Game Center friends and groups they’ve played with in one place, so they can easily enjoy their games together. They can see their shared gaming history, compare achievements, and send friends invite links and party codes using any messaging app, bringing them right into a competition or multiplayer match.\nWith the Apple Games app, it’s easier to compete and play with friends.\nThe Games app introduces challenges, a new way to compete with friends in score-based showdowns. Developers that have Game Center leaderboards for their games can add these unique challenges that are catered to a smaller group of friends. Challenges can turn single-player games into shared experiences with friends, giving them even more ways to rally a group, crown a winner, and have a rematch.\nThe leaderboard after a challenge between friends in the Apple Games app displayed on iPhone 16 Pro. Challenges in the Apple Games app are a new way to compete with friends in score-based showdowns.\nPlayers can invite friends to challenges by selecting their friends or contacts. Whether competing to see who can survive the most waves of enemies in Thronefall, or who can rack up the highest score in each week’s featured course in Skate City: New York, challenges unlock a whole new level of friendly competition.\nStay Up to Date with In-Game Events\nThe Games app introduces new features to help developers keep their players in the know about the latest game updates and can’t-miss events. Game pages in the app come to life, highlighting the latest activity for that specific game. Players can see what’s most relevant to them and the games they’re actively playing, front and center, like updates, live events, and timely activity from their friends.\nAvailability\nThe Games app is available for testing starting today through the Apple Developer Program at developer.apple.com, and a public beta will be available through the Apple Beta Software Program next month at beta.apple.com.\nThe Games app will be released with the launch of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe 26 this fall as a free software update. Features are subject to change. Some features may not be available in all languages or regions, and availability may vary due to local laws and regulations. For more information about availability, visit apple.com.\nMore Game Developer Tools\nAnn Thai of Apple describes the Apple Games app at the WWDC keynote.\nApple announced new technologies and enhancements to help developers create more beautiful, intelligent, and engaging app experiences across Apple platforms.\nThe company also said Game Porting Toolkit 3 provides developers with updated tools for evaluating and profiling their game. Developers can now customize the Metal Performance HUD, and get onscreen insights and guidance for optimizing graphics code for the best possible performance in the evaluation environment. And developers can use Mac Remote Developer Tools for Windows to build Mac games on a remote Mac in their existing development.\nIt also announced Metal 4, which is designed exclusively for Apple silicon. It sets the stage for the next generation of games on Apple platforms with support for advanced graphics and machine learning technologies. Developers can now run inference networks directly in their shaders to compute lighting, materials, and geometry, enabling highly realistic visual effects for their games.\nAnd MetalFX Frame Interpolation generates an intermediate frame for every two input frames to achieve higher and more stable frame rates, and MetalFX Denoising makes real-time ray tracing and path tracing possible in the most advanced games.\nMeanwhile, the MacOS Tahoe 26 and Game Overlay provided a preview into the next release of the operating system, MacOS Tahoe 26 and the new Game Overlay. With the latter, players can conveniently adjust their system settings, chat with friends, or invite them to play, all without having to leave their game. Players can also turn on Low Power Mode, which extends gaming sessions and maximizes playtime on battery.\nMore Games for Mac\nPawel Saska, associate game director at CD Projekt Red showing Cyberpunk 2077 for Mac.\nDevelopers also continue to deliver exciting new games on Mac, including upcoming titles like Crimson Desert and InZOI. Both games leverage powerful software technologies like MetalFX Upscaling to accelerate performance and deliver high-quality visuals, as well as take advantage of the M3 and M4 family of chips with ray tracing for a breathtaking experience.\nOn the Mac version of the Apple Games app, you will also be able to see games that you have downloaded from other sources, like Steam. You will see those games appear in your “continue playing” section for you to get back into and launch right away. There is a curated section for Strategy games, but if I wanted to search for War Games, I would have to type that into search. I did that on the prototype and it came up with a wide variety of war games.\nThere isn’t a tab for multiplayer games, but you can search for them and it will surface important games on the app store. But you won’t find productivity apps or Tinder if you do a search within the Apple Games app.\nAdditional titles on the way include Cyberpunk 2077, Blue Prince, Cronos: The New Dawn, Architect: Land of Exiles, Lies of P: Overture, Hitman: World of Assassination, EVE Frontier, Where Winds Meet, Sniper Elite 5, and more.\nRight now, the Apple Games app will not be on the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, but perhaps that’s more like an eventuality. I got a good look at Cyberpunk 2077 and it look pretty spectacular on a MacBook with an M4 processor. With the Metal 4 and other improvements, the game could run at 120 frames per second, or 120Hz. That made it extremely fluid, including in the most graphics-intensive scene of the game where you go through a kind of bazaar in the middle of Night City.\nIt’s great at capturing the lighting and shadows around Night City’s neon lighting, thanks to tech like the upscaler and frame interpolation in Metal 4, a low-level and compute application programming interface for Macs with Apple-based silicon. It takes advantage of HDR and has support for audio such as AirPods and support for Magic Mouse.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nJust hours after announcing\na big price cut for its o3\nreasoning model,\nOpenAI\nmade o3-pro, an even more powerful version, available to developers.\no3-pro is “designed to think longer and provide the most reliable responses,” and has access to many more software tool integrations than its predecessor, making it potentially appealing to enterprises and developers searching for high levels of detail and accuracy.\nHowever, this model will also be slower than what many developers are accustomed to, having access to computer tools that OpenAI claims make the model more accurate.\n“Because 03-pro has access to tools, responses typically take longer than o1-pro to complete. We recommend using it for challenging questions where reliability matters more than speed, and waiting a few minutes is worth the tradeoff,” the company said in an email to reporters.\nCOME SEE\nOpenAI Head of Product, API Olivier Godement\nin-person at VB TRANSFORM 2025 in San Francisco June 24-25.\nREGISTER NOW\nwhile tickets still remain.\nBut how much longer? We asked OpenAI about how much slower o3-pro is than o3 on average to output responses and will update when we receive one of our own from the company.\nOn X, Hyerbolic Labs co-founder and CTO Yuchen Jin\nposted several screenshots\nof his o3-pro usage showing it took 3 minutes and $80 worth of token to respond to the phrase, “Hi, I’m Sam Altman.”\no3-pro is the slowest and most overthinking model.\nA simple 'Hi' cost me $80. ?\npic.twitter.com/UDQOnYwrT1\n— Yuchen Jin (@Yuchenj_UW)\nJune 10, 2025\nBindu Reddy, CEO of Abacus AI,\nalso said o3-pro took 2 minutes\nto respond to “hey there.”\nhttps://twitter.com/bindureddy/status/1932562799772971295\nHow to use OpenAI o3-pro\nDevelopers can access o3-pro through the OpenAI API as well as for Pro and Team users of ChatGPT. The new model version replaces o1-pro in the model picker for paying ChatGPT users.\nOpenAI said o3-pro “has access to tools that make ChatGPT useful,” such as web search, analyzing files, reason about visual inputs, using Python, and personalize responses.\nThe mode, though, is pricey, which may give some enterprise developers pause. Based on\nOpenAI’s pricing page\n, o3-pro costs $20 per input and $80 for outputs, compared to o3 itself, which is now down to $2 and $8, a tenth of the price.\nA more comprehensive model\nOpenAI\nlaunched o3 and o4-mini\nin April, expanding its “o-series” of models that rely on reasoning and can “think with images.” The new model, o3-pro, uses the same\nunderlying model as o3\n.\nEvaluations conducted by OpenAI showed the o3-pro can often outperform the base model. Expert reviewers ranked o3-pro higher in domains such as science, education, programming, business, and writing help. The company said o3-pro is more effective, more comprehensive, and follows instructions better.\nReasoning models have become a new battleground for model providers, with competitors like\nGoogle\n,\nAnthropic\n, and\nxAI\n, as well as rivals from China, such as\nDeepSeek\n, coming out with their own models designed to think through responses.\nCurrently, o3-pro is not able to generate images, and OpenAI has disabled temporary chats to resolve a technical issue.\nChatGPT’s expanded workspace feature Canvas\nis also not yet accessible using o3-pro.\nSome early users\nclaim\nthat o3-pro has been working remarkably, but it is still early days, and the high cost of running it may deter some developers from experimenting with it.\nSee some initial reactions below:\nAs Ben Hyak, a former Apple Vision Pro interface designer and\nco-founder of startup Raindrop AI\nobservability solutions wrote in a blog post about his early access usage of o3, “It’s noticeably better at discerning what it’s environment is; accurately communicating what tools it has access to, when to ask questions about the outside world (rather than pretending it has the information/access), and choosing the right tool for the job.” OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman also\nhighlighted Hyak’s blog post in an X post.\nSo far, o3-pro has been amazing\nsuper impressed!\nhttps://t.co/nszP8VwXKK\n— Flavio Adamo (@flavioAd)\nJune 10, 2025\nFirst impressions of o3-pro, very powerful, answers take very long, so make sure you know what you're asking before you submit.\n@sama\n, if it is reasoning for 13 minutes, why don't we see more on the right-hand side?\npic.twitter.com/u19a0tJrSO\n— Avi Hacker, J.D. (@Avi_hacker1)\nJune 10, 2025\nShould we bring o3-pro into ChatLLM?\ninput – $20 / 1M input\noutput – $80/ 1M input\nExpensive… could be fun though\nComing to LiveBench AI in a couple of hours…. I am expecting it to top every single leaderboard ?\n— Bindu Reddy (@bindureddy)\nJune 10, 2025\nThe launch also comes at a time when OpenAI said it has reached\nthree million business users\n, with enterprise users surging 50% since February.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nEditor’s note: Louis will lead an editorial roundtable on this topic at VB Transform this month.\nRegister today\n.\nOpen-source AI is shaping the future of cybersecurity innovation, consistently breaking down barriers and delivering results. Its impact spans from agile startups to\nCisco\n‘s Foundation-Sec-8B model, which was downloaded over 18,000 times in just the last month and over 40,000 times since launch.\nVentureBeat is seeing the trend accelerating, especially in cybersecurity startups that are bringing a new level of intensity to turning roadmaps into revenue-producing products. Based on months of interviews with startup founders, open-source AI is now indispensable to them and their teams when it comes to fast-tracking concepts to completed, shippable code.\nDatabricks’ recently announced partnership with Noma Security\ndemonstrates how startups leveraging open-source AI are rapidly disrupting legacy cybersecurity providers by achieving accelerated time-to-market and substantial operational maturity. Cisco’s\nPresident and Chief Product Officer\nJeetu Patel spoke to the critical shift at\nRSAC 2025\n, “AI is fundamentally changing everything, and cybersecurity is at the heart of it all. We’re no longer dealing with human-scale threats; these attacks are occurring at machine scale.”\nVentureBeat’s numerous interviews with cybersecurity industry leaders, particularly founders, reveal that open-source AI is essential for enabling businesses to sharpen their focus on key unmet needs across the broad base of enterprise prospects they successfully turn into customers. While open-source AI and the wider software industry drive unprecedented levels of new venture creation and innovation, they also fuel a growing paradox encompassing security, compliance and monetization.\nVentureBeat continues to see successful cybersecurity startups navigate these complexities and discover new strengths in their apps, tools, and platforms that weren’t anticipated when they were first created and delivered.\nThe best-run startups are quick to capitalize on these unforeseen strengths and apply a more disciplined and deliberate approach to governance, recognizing the long-term benefits of that strategy. They’re also faster in adopting as much automation as possible. Most impressive is how they view themselves as building communities for decades to come, all predicated on the ability to pivot product strategy on open source.\nDecoding the open source paradox\nOpen-source AI’s ability to act as an innovation catalyst is proven. What is unknown is the downside or the paradox that’s being created with the all-out focus on performance and the ubiquity of platform development and support. At the center of the paradox for every company building with open-source AI is the need to keep it open to fuel innovation, yet gain control over security vulnerabilities and the complexity of compliance.\nGartner’s\nHype Cycle for Open-Source Software, 2024\n,\nhighlights this stark contradiction, noting that high-risk vulnerabilities within open-source codebases\nsurged 26% annually and\nn\now average nearly three years before resolution.\nAt\nRSAC 2025\n, Diana Kelly, CTO of Protect AI, crystallized the stakes during her session titled\nPrinciples of GenAI Security: Foundations for Building Security In.\nShe said that “organizations routinely download open-source AI models without adequate security checks, significantly amplifying vulnerability risks.”\nRegulatory compliance is becoming more complex and expensive, further fueling the paradox. Startup founders, however, tell VentureBeat that the high costs of compliance can be offset by the data their systems generate.\nThey’re quick to point out that they do not intend to deliver governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) solutions; however, their apps and platforms are meeting the needs of enterprises in this area, especially across Europe. With enforcement of the\nEU\nA\nI Act imminent\n,\nPrompt Security\nCEO Itamar Golan emphasized the urgency of embedding compliance at the strategic core during an\ninterview completed earlier this year\nwith VentureBeat. “EU AI Act, for example, is starting its enforcement in February, and the pace of enforcement and fines is much higher and aggressive than GDPR. From our perspective, we want to help organizations navigate those frameworks, ensuring they’re aware of the tools available to leverage AI safely and map them to risk levels dictated by the Act.”\nGolan further explained, “A very big portion of the current cybersecurity market is derived only from GDPR, and as I see it, the AI regulation is going to be much more aggressive than GDPR. It’s very rational that by around 2028, a very big market will be allocated to AI compliance.”\nStartup founders’ common goal: make a lasting contribution to the open-source community\nNearly every cybersecurity startup founder VentureBeat has interviewed over the last five years mentions how contributing to the open-source community is core to the company they’re creating. Many strive to make this one of the core elements of their business DNA.\nThe most successful cybersecurity startups realize that making ongoing, significant contributions to open-source communities builds sustainable competitive advantages and industry leadership.\nCisco’s Foundation-Sec-8B model\nexemplifies how targeted, purpose-built cybersecurity tools substantially enhance overall community resilience. The Foundation-Sec-8B model has been downloaded 18,278 times in the last 30 days alone, according to its page on\nHugging Face.\nFoundation Sec-8B is an 8 billion parameter model that can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, including threat detection and auto-remediation.\nMeta’s AI Defenders Suite\nand\nProjectDiscovery’s Nuclei\nfurther illustrate how focused open-source contributions significantly improve ecosystem security and industry-wide collaboration.\nNiv Braun, Co-founder and CEO of\nNoma Security\n, reinforced the critical importance of sustained community-building strategies during a recent interview, telling VentureBeat, “The community we’re building is much, much more valuable and will be much more long-lasting than any yearly revenue figure. Building a community that people rely on is absolutely critical”.\nKey Takeaways from open-source cybersecurity leaders\nDrawing on insights from Braun, Golan, Kelly, Patel, and over a dozen interviews with cybersecurity founders, CEOs, and leaders, five key takeaways emerge as foundational to succeeding with open-source AI. They are as follows:\nEmbed governance strategically\nEstablish an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) to manage licensing, compliance, and vulnerabilities centrally. Embed governance dashboards directly into products, offering real-time regulatory compliance visibility as core differentiation. Braun highlighted governance’s transformative potential during his recent interview with VentureBeat, saying, “Governance isn’t overhead—it’s our key differentiator, enabling seamless compliance.”\nAutomate security aggressively with generative AI\nImplement generative AI extensively to automate security processes, including vulnerability detection, remediation, and real-time threat management. As Golan articulates clearly: “Generative AI-driven automation dramatically streamlines operations and enhances security efficiency beyond manual capabilities.”\nStrategically contribute purpose-built tools\nActively contribute specialized, purpose-built cybersecurity models back into open-source communities, enhancing collective security resilience. Jeetu Patel succinctly captured this perspective during his keynote at RSAC and interview with VentureBeat: “The true enemy isn’t our competitor. It’s the adversary. Purpose-built open-source contributions are critical for collective cybersecurity resilience.”\nProactively manage and transparently communicate Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)\nClearly articulate TCO, transparently addressing hidden costs and long-term value. Proactively managing TCO calculations reduces customer uncertainty and enhances market confidence, directly addressing Gartner’s challenges around vendor lock-in perceptions.\nPrioritize rigorous and proactive risk management\nContinuously deploy automated vulnerability scanning and remediation, maintain curated internal OSS catalogs, and automate compliance documentation (SBOM/VEX) to streamline audits, minimize risk exposure, and simplify regulatory compliance. Kelly emphasized during her keynote at RSAC 2025, “Rigorous, automated risk management is essential to managing open-source cybersecurity effectively.”\nConclusion: Mastering open source for strategic advantage\nFor cybersecurity startups, strategically leveraging open-source AI offers unparalleled innovation, differentiation and sustained growth opportunities. Embedding governance deeply, automating security through generative AI, contributing purpose-built community tools, proactively managing total cost of ownership (TCO) and rigorously mitigating risks positions startups as industry leaders capable of driving significant cybersecurity transformation.\nAs Jeetu Patel summarized at RSAC 2025: “Strategic open-source innovation is essential to collectively securing our digital future. The adversary—not competitors—is our true challenge.”\nBy embracing these strategic insights, cybersecurity startups can confidently navigate the complexities of open-source software, driving transformative industry leadership and long-term competitive success.\nJoin me at VB Transform 2025\nI’ll be hosting a roundtable focused on this topic, called “Building Cybersecurity Apps with Open Source,” at\nVentureBeat Transform 2025\n, happening June 24–25 at Fort Mason in San Francisco.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nA new framework from researchers at the\nUniversity of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign\n, and\nthe University of California, Berkeley\ngives developers more control over how large language models (LLMs) “think,” improving their reasoning capabilities while making more efficient use of their inference budget.\nThe framework, called\nAlphaOne\n(α1), is a\ntest-time scaling\ntechnique, tweaking a model’s behavior during inference without needing costly retraining. It provides a universal method for modulating the reasoning process of advanced LLMs, offering developers the flexibility to improve performance on complex tasks in a more controlled and cost-effective manner than existing approaches.\nThe challenge of slow thinking\nIn recent years, developers of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as\nOpenAI o3\nand\nDeepSeek-R1\n, have incorporated mechanisms inspired by\n“System 2” thinking\n—the slow, deliberate, and logical mode of human cognition. This is distinct from “System 1” thinking, which is fast, intuitive, and automatic. Incorporating System 2 capabilities enables models to solve complex problems in domains like mathematics, coding, and data analysis.\nModels are trained to automatically generate transition tokens like “wait,” “hmm,” or “alternatively” to trigger slow thinking. When one of these tokens appears, the model pauses to self-reflect on its previous steps and correct its course, much like a person pausing to rethink a difficult problem.\nHowever, reasoning models don’t always effectively use their slow-thinking capabilities. Different studies show they are prone to either “overthinking” simple problems, wasting computational resources, or “underthinking” complex ones, leading to incorrect answers.\nAs the\nAlphaOne paper\nnotes, “This is because of the inability of LRMs to find the optimal human-like system-1-to-2 reasoning transitioning and limited reasoning capabilities, leading to unsatisfactory reasoning performance.”\nThere are two common methods to address this. Parallel scaling, like the “best-of-N” approach, runs a model multiple times and picks the best answer, which is computationally expensive. Sequential scaling attempts to modulate the thinking process during a single run. For example,\ns1\nis a technique that forces more slow thinking by adding “wait” tokens in the model’s context, while the “\nChain of Draft\n” (CoD) method prompts the model to use fewer words, thereby reducing its thinking budget. These methods, however, offer rigid, one-size-fits-all solutions that are often inefficient.\nA universal framework for reasoning\nInstead of simply increasing or reducing the thinking budget, the researchers behind AlphaOne asked a more fundamental question: Is it possible to develop a better strategy for transitioning between slow and fast thinking that can modulate reasoning budgets universally?\nTheir framework, AlphaOne, gives developers fine-grained control over the model’s reasoning process at test time. The system works by introducing Alpha (α), a parameter that acts as a dial to scale the model’s thinking phase budget.\nBefore a certain point in the generation, which the researchers call the “α moment,” AlphaOne strategically schedules how frequently it inserts a “wait” token to encourage slow, deliberate thought. This allows for what the paper describes as “both controllable and scalable thinking.”\nOnce the “α moment” is reached, the framework inserts a </think> token in the mode’s context, ending the slow thinking process and forcing the model to switch to fast reasoning and produce its final answer.\nPrevious techniques typically apply what the researchers call “sparse modulation,” making only a few, isolated adjustments, such as adding a “wait” token once or twice during the entire process. AlphaOne, in contrast, can be configured to intervene often (dense) or rarely (sparse), giving developers more granular control than other methods.\nAlphaOne modulates reasoning by adding “wait” tokens into the model’s context at different intervals Source: AlphaOne GitHub page\n“We see AlphaOne as a unified interface for deliberate reasoning, complementary to chain-of-thought prompting or preference-based tuning, and capable of evolving alongside model architectures,” the AlphaOne team told VentureBeat in written comments. “The key takeaway is not tied to implementation details, but to the general principle: slow-to-fast structured modulation of the reasoning process enhances capability and efficiency.”\nAlphaOne in action\nThe researchers tested AlphaOne on three different reasoning models, with parameter sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion. They evaluated its performance across six challenging benchmarks in mathematics, code generation, and scientific problem-solving.\nThey compared AlphaOne against three baselines: the vanilla, unmodified model; the s1 method that monotonically increases slow thinking; and the Chain of Draft (CoD) method that monotonically decreases it.\nThe results produced several key findings that are particularly relevant for developers building AI applications.\nFirst, a “slow thinking first, then fast thinking” strategy leads to better reasoning performance in LRMs. This highlights a fundamental gap between LLMs and human cognition, which is usually structured based on fast thinking followed by slow thinking. Unlike humans, researchers found that models benefit from enforced slow thinking before acting fast.\n“This suggests that effective AI reasoning emerges not from mimicking human experts, but from explicitly modulating reasoning dynamics, which aligns with practices such as prompt engineering and staged inference already used in real-world applications,” the AlphaOne team said. “For developers, this means that system design should actively impose a slow-to-fast reasoning schedule to improve performance and reliability, at least for now, while model reasoning remains imperfect.”\nAnother interesting finding was that investing in slow thinking can lead to more efficient inference overall. “While slow thinking slows down reasoning, the overall token length is significantly reduced with α1, inducing more informative reasoning progress brought by slow thinking,” the paper states. This means that although the model takes more time to “think,” it produces a more concise and accurate reasoning path, ultimately reducing the total number of tokens generated and lowering inference costs.\nCompared to s1-style baselines, AlphaOne reduces average token usage by ~21%, resulting in lower compute overhead, while concurrently boosting reasoning accuracy by 6.15%, even on PhD-level math, science, and code problems.\nWhile AlphaOne makes slow progress in the beginning, it ends up getting better results with fewer tokens compared to other test-time scaling methods\nSource: AlphaOne GitHub page\n“For enterprise applications like complex query answering or code generation, these gains translate into a dual benefit: improved generation quality and significant cost savings,” AlphaOne said. “These can lead to lower inference costs while improving task success rates and user satisfaction.”\nFinally, the study found that inserting “wait” tokens with high frequency is helpful, with AlphaOne achieving better results by appending the token significantly more often than previous methods.\nBy giving developers a new level of control, the AlphaOne framework, whose code is expected to be released soon, could help them build more stable, reliable, and efficient applications on top of the next generation of reasoning models.\n“For companies using open-source or custom-built models, especially those trained with transitioning tokens during the pre-training phase, AlphaOne is designed to be easy to integrate,” the AlphaOne team told VentureBeat. “In practice, integration typically requires minimal changes, such as simply updating the model name in the configuration scripts.”\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nEuropean AI powerhouse\nMistral today launched Magistral\n, a new family of large language models (LLMs) that marks the first from the company to enter the increasingly competitive space of “reasoning,” or models that take time to reflect on their thinking to catch errors and solve more complex tasks than basic text-based LLMs.\nThe announcement features a strategic dual release: a powerful, proprietary Magistral Medium for enterprise clients, and, notably, a 24-billion parameter open-source version, Magistral Small.\nThe latter release appears calculated to reinforce the company’s commitment to its foundational roots, following a period where it faced criticism for leaning into more closed, proprietary models such as its\nMedium 3 for enterprises, launched back in May 2025\n.\nA return to open source roots\nIn a move that will undoubtedly be celebrated by developers and the wider AI community,\nMistral is releasing Magistral Small under the permissive open source Apache 2.0 license\n.\nThis is a crucial detail. Unlike more restrictive licenses, Apache 2.0 allows anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute the model’s source code, even for commercial purposes.\nThis empowers startups and established companies alike to build and deploy their own applications on top of Mistral’s latest reasoning architecture without licensing fees or fear of vendor lock-in.\nThis open approach is particularly significant given the context. While Mistral built its reputation on powerful open models, its recent release of Medium 3 as a purely proprietary offering drew concern from some quarters of the open-source community, who worried the company was drifting towards a more closed ecosystem, similar to competitors like OpenAI.\nThe release of Magistral Small under such a permissive license serves as a powerful counter-narrative, reaffirming Mistral’s dedication to arming the open community with cutting-edge tools.\nCompetitive performance against formidable foes\nMistral isn’t just talking a big game; it came with receipts. The company released a suite of benchmarks pitting Magistral-Medium against its own predecessor, Mistral-Medium 3, and competitors from Deepseek. The results show a model that is fiercely competitive in the reasoning arena.\nOn the AIME-24 mathematics benchmark, Magistral-Medium scores an impressive 73.6% on accuracy, neck-and-neck with its predecessor and significantly outperforming Deepseek’s models. When using majority voting (a technique where the model generates multiple answers and the most common one is chosen), its performance on AIME-24 jumps to a staggering 90%.\nThe new model also holds its own across other demanding tests, including GPQA Diamond, a graduate-level question-answering benchmark, and LiveCodeBench for coding challenges.\nWhile Deepseek-V3 shows strong performance on some benchmarks, Magistral-Medium consistently proves itself to be a top-tier reasoning model, validating Mistral’s claims of its advanced capabilities.\nEnterprise power\nWhile Magistral Small caters to the open-source world, the benchmark-validated\nMagistral Medium\nis aimed squarely at the enterprise.\nIt’s acessible via Mistral’s Le Chat interface and La Plateforme API, it delivers the top-tier performance needed for mission-critical tasks.\nMistral is making this model available on major cloud platforms, including Amazon SageMaker, with Azure AI, IBM WatsonX, and Google Cloud Marketplace to follow.\nThis dual-release strategy allows Mistral to have its cake and eat it too: fostering a vibrant ecosystem around its open models while monetizing its most powerful, performance-tested technology for corporate clients.\nCost comparison\nWhen it comes to cost, Mistral is positioning Magistral Medium as a distinct, premium offering, even compared to its own models.\nAt $2 per million input tokens and $5 per million output tokens, it represents a significant price increase from the older Mistral Medium 3, which costs just $0.40 for input and $2 for output.\nHowever, when placed against its external rivals, Magistral Medium’s pricing strategy appears highly aggressive. Its input cost matches that of OpenAI’s latest model and sits within the range of Gemini 2.5 Pro, yet its $5 output price substantially undercuts both, which are priced at $8 and upwards of $10, respectively.\nMagistral API cost compared to other leading LLM reasoners. Credit: VentureBeat made with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (Preview)\nWhile it is considerably more expensive than specialized models like DeepSeek-Reasoner, it is an order of magnitude cheaper than Anthropic’s flagship Claude Opus 4, making it a compelling value proposition for customers seeking state-of-the-art reasoning without paying the absolute highest market prices.\nReasoning you can view, understand and use\nMistral is pushing three core advantages with the Magistral line: transparency, multilingualism, and speed.\nBreaking away from the “black box” nature of many AI models, Magistral is designed to produce a traceable “chain-of-thought.” This allows users to follow the model’s logical path, a critical feature for high-stakes professional fields like law, finance, and healthcare, where conclusions must be verifiable.\nFurthermore, these reasoning capabilities are global. Mistral emphasizes the model’s “multilingual dexterity,” highlighting high-fidelity performance in languages including French, Spanish, German, Italian, Arabic, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.\nOn the performance front, the company claims a major speed boost. A new “Think mode” and “Flash Answers” feature in Le Chat reportedly enables Magistral Medium to achieve up to 10 times the token throughput of competitors, facilitating real-time reasoning at a scale previously unseen.\nFrom code gen to creative strategy and beyond\nThe applications for Magistral are vast. Mistral is targeting any use case that demands precision and structured thought, from financial modeling and legal analysis to software architecture and data engineering. The company even showcased the model’s ability to generate a one-shot physics simulation, demonstrating its grasp of complex systems.\nBut it’s not all business. Mistral also recommends the model as a “creative companion” for writing and storytelling, capable of producing work that is either highly coherent or, as the company puts it, “delightfully eccentric.”\nWith Magistral, Mistral AI is making a strategic play to not just compete, but lead in the next frontier of AI. By re-engaging its open-source base with a powerful, permissively licensed model while simultaneously pushing the envelope on enterprise-grade performance, the company is signaling that the future of reasoning AI will be both powerful and, in a meaningful way, open to all.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nGood news, AI developers!\nOpenAI has announced a\nsubstantial price cut on o3\n, its flagship reasoning large language model (LMM),\nslashing costs by a whopping 80% for both input and output tokens\n.\n(Recall tokens are the individual numeric strings that LLMs use to represent words, phrases, mathematical and coding strings, and other content. They are representations of the semantic constructions the model has learned through training, and in essence, are the LLMs’ native language. Most LLM providers offer their models through application programming interfaces or APIs that developers can build apps atop of or plug their external apps into, and most LLM providers charge them for the privilege at a cost per million tokens).\nThe update positions the model as a more accessible option for developers seeking advanced reasoning capabilities, and places OpenAI in more direct pricing competition with rival models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro from Google DeepMind, Claude Opus 4 from Anthropic, and DeepSeek’s reasoning suite.\nCOME SEE\nOpenAI Head of Product, API Olivier Godement\nin-person at VB TRANSFORM 2025 in San Francisco June 24-25.\nREGISTER NOW\nwhile tickets still remain.\nAnnounced by Altman himself on X\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, confirmed the change in a\npost on X\nhighlighting that the new pricing is intended to encourage broader experimentation, writing: “we dropped the price of o3 by 80%!! excited to see what people will do with it now. think you’ll also be happy with o3-pro pricing for the performance :)”\nThe cost of using o3 is now $2 per million input tokens and $8 per million output tokens, with an extra discount of $0.50 per million tokens when the user enters information that has been “cached,” or is stored and identical to what they provided before.\nThis marks a significant reduction from the previous rates of $10 (input) and $40 (output), as\nOpenAI researcher Noam Brown\npointed out on X.\nRay Fernando\n, a developer and early adopter, celebrated the pricing drop in a post writing “LFG!” short for “let’s fucking go!”\nThe sentiment reflects a growing enthusiasm among builders looking to scale their projects without prohibitive model access costs.\nPrice comparison to other rival reasoning LLMs\nThe price adjustment comes at a time when AI providers are competing more aggressively on both performance and affordability. A comparison with other leading AI reasoning models illustrates how significant this move could be:\nGemini 2.5 Pro Preview\n, developed by Google DeepMind, charges between $1.25 and $2.50 for input depending on prompt size, and $10 to $15 for output. While its integration with Google Search offers additional functionality, that service carries its own cost — free for the first 1,500 requests per day, then $35 per thousand requests.\nClaude Opus 4\n, marketed by Anthropic as a model optimized for complex tasks, is the most expensive of the group, charging $15 per million input tokens and $75 for output. Prompt caching read and write services come at $1.50 and $18.75 respectively, although users can unlock a 50% discount with batch processing.\nDeepSeek’s models, particularly DeepSeek-Reasoner and DeepSeek-Chat, undercut much of the market with aggressive low pricing. Input tokens range from $0.07 to $0.55 depending on caching and time of day, while output ranges from $1.10 to $2.19. Discounted rates during off-peak hours bring prices down even further, to as low as $0.035 for cached inputs.\nModel\nInput\nCached Input\nOutput\nDiscount Notes\nOpenAI o3\n$2.00 (down from $10.00)\n$0.50\n$8.00 (down from $40.00)\nFlex Processing: $5 / $20\nGemini 2.5 Pro\n$1.25 – $2.50\n$0.31 – $0.625\n$10.00 – $15.00\nHigher rate applies to prompts >200k tokens\nClaude Opus 4\n$15.00\n$1.50 (read) / $18.75 (write)\n$75.00\n50% off with batch processing\nDeepSeek-Chat\n$0.07 (hit)$0.27 (miss)\n—\n$1.10\n50% off during off-peak hours\nDeepSeek-Reasoner\n$0.14 (hit)$0.55 (miss)\n—\n$2.19\n75% off during off-peak hours\nIn addition, independent third-party AI model comparison and research group Artificial Analysis ran the new o3 through its suite of benchmarking tests on various tasks, and found it cost $390 to complete them all, versus $971 for Gemini 2.5 Pro and $342 for Claude 4 Sonnet.\nNarrowing the cost vs. intelligence gap for developers\nOpenAI’s pricing move not only narrows the gap with ultra-low-cost models like DeepSeek but also puts downward pressure on higher-priced offerings like Claude Opus and Gemini Pro.\nUnlike Claude or Gemini, OpenAI’s o3 also now offers a flex mode for synchronous processing that charges $5 for input and $20 for output per million tokens, giving developers more control over compute cost and latency depending on workload type.\no3 is currently available through the OpenAI API and Playground. Users with balances as low as a few dollars can now explore the model’s full capabilities, enabling prototyping and deployment with fewer financial barriers.\nThis could particularly benefit startups, research teams, and individual developers who previously found higher-tier model access cost-prohibitive.\nBy substantially lowering the cost of its most advanced reasoning model, OpenAI is signaling a broader trend in the generative AI space: premium performance is quickly becoming more affordable, and developers now have a growing number of viable, economically scalable options.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The app was released in the Meta Store in partnership with major treadmill and cycling brands, Woodway and WattBike, who are bringing their machines to\nAWE 2025\n.\n“Our gamified experience for the bike has a game where users punch and dodge targets with their body and arms to the beat of the music while they are pedaling the bike,” said Jenna Arndt, cofounder and head of fitness at Kinneta, in an interview with GamesBeat. “What’s really cool about this is that we’ve actually enabled connected mode so the users’ pedaling directly impacts the score of their workout. The closer they are to hitting the beat, the bigger their score is going to get. So that’s one of our main new products.”\nAt AWE, the company will debut gamified workouts for Xreal AR glasses, where bike users go through competitive full-body mobility rhythm-based challenges, in which alignment of the user’s cadence on the WattBike with the beat of the song gives the user powerups in the game, said Arndt.\nArndt said, “This is going to be available both in VR and AR, so at the conference, we’ll be showing it on the Meta Quest as well as on the Xreal glasses. And then, addition to that, we have our other new product — trainer-led scenic moving workouts. We’ll be debuting a trainer leading the user through Central Park.”\nThe company will also debut groundbreaking VR tech for Meta Quest headsets, that takes users on a photorealistic 3D trainer-led Central Park run with automatic Woodway treadmill speed and incline adjustments, where the VR movement precisely replicates the movement on the fitness machine. The team can adjust the difficulty of the workout, like whether it’s going uphill or not. The visuals are pretty realistic and so they can hold the user’s attention. And using good capture equipment, Kinneta can reproduce the great visuals in XR. The stats come from the machine and can be analyzed in the app.\nAnd the company will announce a new big partnership with TrueForm.\nFor the moment, most players are home XR users. But over time, the company hopes more gyms will offer the equipment for their members, Arndt said. Equinox, a gym company, has hundreds of gyms and it is considering rolling it out.\n“Everybody’s waiting for lighter headsets, less expensive headsets, and higher resolution,” said Polokhin.\nOrigins\nIlya Polokhin is cofounder and CEO of Kinneta.\nIlya Polokhin, CEO of Kinneta, began working with VR motion simulators back in 2014, after managing operations in automotive and retail for 15 years. He started a U.S. VR simulation center, Hubneo VR Lab, in 2017. Then he cofounded Octonic with David Wen, the chief engineer of Kinneta, in 2020. His main hobbies are VR gaming and long-distance running, and he decided to marry them.\nWen has more than eight years of experience working on everything from full-stack applications to system-level operations and AI. He has been in VR development with Unity since joining Polokhin at Hubneo VR Lab in 2017. Outside of work, David is a competitive strategy game player and Expert+ Beat Saber regular.\nNahiyan Ahmad, cofounder and head of business development, was previously played key roles at Jump Into The Light, a VR center in Manhattan, where he also produced creative content alongside artists like Bill Pullman and Patricia Field. He has more than seven years of experience in the XR space.\nAnd Arndt has over 12 years of experience in the health and wellness industry. She was a founding team member at several boutique fitness studios across New York City and spent nearly a decade at Swerve Fitness, where she served as Head Trainer and VP of Fitness Programming.\nStarting in 2021, Polokhin and Wen used their expertise to build a locomotion solution for fitness treadmills.\n“It was a good combination of our technical expertise in VR and passion,” Polokhin said. “So the idea was that we would actually allow people to run on a fitness treadmill or bike on a site like stationary cycle while they’re in virtual reality. So that’s how it all came together.”\nThe team has eight people. That’s a small team, considering some of the competition includes Peloton, which sell a lot of fitness treadmills.\n“The competition for us is more changing the mindset of people, rather than any other XR startup that is trying to do something in the fitness industry identical to us,” Polokhin said.\nThe company has a subscription model for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year, said Wen. AR has a lot of tailwinds right now as AR glasses are being married with generative AI, which is taking off due to all of the excitement around AI and Apple’s move into mixed reality headsets.\n“We’re waiting for another generation of Apple headsets,” Polokhin said. “We want to open up more and more different experiences.”\nRight now, Kinneta has more than 50 different environments — locations where people can travel to — and many of the company’s workouts are themed, Arndt said. The core of the IP is that the app connects with bikes and treadmills. The company has raised $1.5 million to date, including $250,000 recently from Woodway, a fitness brand.\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

It was a glimpse into how we’re turning AI glasses, which have long been considered an accessory, into a standalone, comprehensive capable device.\nThe company also unveiled its Snapdragon AR1+ Gen 1 processor, which is 26% smaller than the previous generations, to power the demo.\n“On Tuesday, as I stood on stage at AWE USA, the world’s largest XR conference, I chatted with an AI assistant through a pair of RayNeo X3 Pro smart glasses powered by Snapdragon technology, – with AI inferencing done on the glasses without relying on the cloud or an internet connection,” said Ziad Asghar, senior vice president of XR & spatial computing at Qualcomm, in a statement.\nQualocomm has launched a lot of XR glasses in the past year.\nHe said the premise is simple: AI glasses are set to operate independently without needing to be paired with a smartphone or the cloud.\n“In the near future, I will be able to leave my phone in my pocket or in the car and just wear my smart glasses during a supermarket run, as I showed off during my AWE demo,” Asghar said. “While on stage, I was at the ‘supermarket’ and asked my glasses for help with fettuccine alfredo I needed to make for my daughter’s birthday party.”\nIn response, the AI assistant, running Llama 1B, a small language model (SLM), understood the specific request and provided him with the information he needed through audio and text displayed in the lens of his glasses.\nThis demonstration was a world’s first: an Autoregressive Generative AI model running completely on a pair of smart glasses. No phone. No cloud. Just the processor powering the glasses themselves. And this industry milestone was pulled off in front of a live audience, he said.\nTopping this off was the announcement of our Snapdragon AR1+ Gen 1 processor, which is 26% smaller than the previous generations and brings enhanced image quality, size, power improvement and the ability to run SLMs. All four of these traits are critical for compact smart glasses.\nTogether, they open the door to a revolution in AI smart glasses, with thinner, lighter and more varied glass designs paired with enough power to run AI assistants right on the device.\nSo, while the demo was just one example of what you can do with completely on-device AI on smart glasses, the benefits that stem from the work going on at Qualcomm, are long-lasting and massive.\nExpand and evolve\nQualcomm’s announcments.\nThere isn’t one path that XR headsets and smart glasses will take, especially since we also offer mixed reality processors such as Snapdragon XR2 and Snapdragon XR2+ that also have significant inferencing capability on the device.\nAsghar said he anticipates several different form factors, from standalone glasses powerful enough to run AI models themselves, to more lightweight frames linked to phones or nearby small computing “pucks” that can link anything from a car to a tablet. What Qualcomm is doing with the portfolio is getting ready for the future.\nWhether it’s cloud computing, on-device, or a hybrid path that incorporates both, the boost in on-device AI capabilities will offer a seamless and ultra-low latency user experience that’s also security-focused. That will be critical as AI-powered smart glasses find their way into sectors with mission-critical needs and users demand more personalization, more privacy features, and an end-to-end agentic experience.\n“We’ve already seen significant momentum in the XR industry over the last year. In December, we collaborated with Google and Samsung to launch Android XR, an operating system designed with AI at the core of the XR experience,” he said.\nThis comes as the industry continues to expand, with Meta’s Ray-Ban Glasses, as well as more ambitious hardware such as Meta Orion, which it bills as the company’s first true augmented reality glasses with their own digital overlay.\nIn addition, Asghar said we’ve seen glasses from Rokid, RayNeo, XREAL and more. In March, BleeqUp launched a pair of AI-powered sports glasses.\nImagine what these companies will be able to accomplish with smaller, more powerful platforms like Snapdragon AR1+ Gen 1, enabling sleeker form factors that don’t compromise on the ability to run AI models, Asghar said.\nSmarter, more aware\nQualcomm is blending XR and AI.\nWhile getting smart glasses down to a reasonable size and fit is critical, another advance that Snapdragon AR1+ Gen 1 brings is camera capabilities typically found in premium smartphones, which is equally important to where they’re evolving.\nThat ability to see the world that you see – with every minute detail – will open new avenues of multimodal inputs. That capability is critical for AI to not only better understand what you see, but also connect the dots in a way that lets it proactively offer suggestions or additional context on an object or location.\nAnd while smart glasses will be able to run SLMs on their own, that doesn’t mean they won’t work in tandem with a constellation of devices around you, whether it’s your smartphone or PC. In fact, I see smart watches and new devices such as smart rings or other wearable sensors that will enable new modalities of input as they work in concert with your glasses.\nAt Qualcomm Technologies, we are preparing for a multifaceted future with a wide range of device combinations by creating a modular architecture that allows our partners to tap into the spatial computing industry to deliver a superior experience to consumers.\nThat’s why I know this conversation with my smart glasses’ AI assistant is such a pivotal moment – it really marked the beginning of something huge. The work we’re doing is just starting to unlock the game-changing potential of a deeper and more personalized agentic experience.\n“A world’s first on-glass Gen AI demonstration: Qualcomm’s vision for the future of smart glasses,” said Qualcomm. “Our live demonstration of a generative AI assistant running completely on smart glasses – without the aid of a phone or the cloud — and the reveal of the new Snapdragon AR1+ platform spark new possibilities for augmented reality.”\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.
