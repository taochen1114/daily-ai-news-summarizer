According to the report, “70% of security leaders were most protected against general phishing attacks, with only 28% of firms reporting compromise.”\nSVP also found that 77% of CISOs believe protecting AI/ML models and data pipelines is a priority to improve their security posture by 2025, up from 55% last year. Notably, given the influx of new agentic AI solutions announced at RSAC, 75% of firms expressed interest in leveraging AI to automate SOC investigations using AI agents to triage large volumes of security alerts to prevent security incidents.\nSource: Scale Venture Partners, Cybersecurity Perspectives 2025 report.\nSVP’s rise in efficacy numbers isn’t accidental; they result from CISOs and their teams adopting automation at scale while successfully consolidating their platforms and reducing gaps attackers had walked through in the past.\n“If you don’t have complete visibility, the attackers are going to go through the cracks between products,”  Etay Maor, senior director of security strategy at Cato Networks, told VentureBeat during RSAC 2025. “We designed our platform to eliminate those blind spots—bringing security and networking together so nothing escapes our eyes.”\nAgentic AI is moving fast beyond minimum viable product to platform DNA\nMaor’s perspective explains why a new definition of what a minimum viable product is needed for agentic AI in cybersecurity. RSAC 2025 revealed how mature agentic AI is becoming. There’s a group of vendors using agentic AI as a code-based adhesive to unify code bases and apps together, and then there are the ones who have been at this for years, and agentic AI is core to their code base and architecture.\nCybersecurity providers in this latter group, where agentic AI is core to their platform and, in many cases, continue to double-down their R&D spend on excelling at agentic AI. This includes\nCato Networks’ SASE Cloud Platform\n,\nCisco AI Defense\n,\nCrowdStrike’s Falcon single agent architecture\n,\nDarktrace’s Cyber AI Loop\n,\nElastic’s Elastic AI Assistant\n,\nMicrosoft’s Security Copilot and Defender XDR Suite,\nPalo Alto Networks’ Cortex XSIAM\n,\nSentinelOne’s Singularity Platform\nand\nVectra AI’s Cognito Platform\n.\nOrganizations that are relying on integrated AI-driven detection with automated containment are reducing dwell times by over\n40%\n. They’re also\nnearly twice as likely\nto neutralize phishing-based intrusions before lateral movement occurs. Vendors on the show floor often relied on identity and access management scenarios to showcase how their agentic AI workflows could help trim workloads for security operations center (SOC) analysts.\nMicrosoft’s Vasu Jakkal outlines six critical pillars for securing agentic AI, emphasizing security “by design, default, and all around” at RSAC 2025.\n“Identity is going to be a critical element of AI throughout its life cycle. AI agents are going to need identities. They’re going to need to understand zero trust, and how do we verify them? Explicitly manage least privileged access,” noted Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President for Security, Vasu Jakkal, during her keynote. As Jakkal succinctly put it, “AI must first start with security. It’s critical that we evolve our security mechanisms as rapidly as we evolve AI.”\nA common theme of every agentic AI demo across the show floor was triangulating attack data, quickly gaining insights into the form of tradecraft being used and then defining a containment strategy all in real time.\nCrowdStrike showed how agentic AI can pivot from detection to real-time action through a live investigation of a North Korean threat campaign to place remote DevOps hires in strategic technology companies in the U.S. and around the world. The live demo followed the tradecraft of the\nDPRK’s Famous Chollima\nas it impersonated a remote DevOps hire, slipped past HR checks and leveraged legitimate tools, including RMM software and VS Code, to quietly exfiltrate data. It was a sharp reminder that, while powerful, agentic AI still relies on a human in the loop to spot adaptive threats and fine-tune models before the signal gets lost in the noise.\nThe gen AI goal: discovering nation-state tradecraft and killing it\nIt’s the attacks that no person, company, or nation sees coming that are the most devastating and challenging to contain and overcome. The thought of threats so devastating that they could easily shut down a power grid, payment, banking, or supply chain system dominates the minds of many of the brightest and most innovative technologies in cybersecurity.\nCisco’s Chief Product Officer Jeetu Patel emphasized the urgency of strengthening cybersecurity with AI so that threats lurking that may be devastating once triggered can be found now and neutralized. “AI is fundamentally changing everything, and cybersecurity is at the heart of it. We’re no longer dealing with human-scale threats; these attacks are occurring at machine scale,” Patel said during his keynote.\nPatel emphasized that AI-driven models are not deterministic: “They won’t give you the same answer every single time, introducing unprecedented risks.”​\nCISOs need to understand today’s complex risks and threats\n“This isn’t another AI talk, I promise,” CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz joked as he opened his RSAC 2025 keynote. “I was asked to give one, and I said, ‘How about we talk about something that actually matters right now, like getting CISOs a seat at the board table?’” That punchline delivered two things at once: comic relief and a sharp pivot to the defining issue of cybersecurity leadership in 2025.\nIn his keynote,\n“The CISO’s Guide to Securing a Board Seat,”\nKurtz issued a clear call\nto act\nion: “Cybersecurity is no longer a compliance suggestion. It’s a governance mandate. The SEC regulations have materially changed the arc of the CISO’s career.” Boards aren’t just evolving; they’re being forced to reckon with cyber risk as a primary business threat.\nKurtz backed his argument with hard numbers: 72% of boards say they’re actively seeking cybersecurity expertise, but only 29% actually have it\n.\n“That’s not just a talent gap,” Kurtz said. “It’s an opportunity if you’re ready to step up,” he encouraged the audience.\nHis roadmap for CISOs to reach the boardroom was tactical and hands-on:\nLevel up your business fluency.\n“Understand where business value is created. If you can’t speak margin, ARR, or legal risk, you won’t last long at the table.”\nSpeak the board’s language.\n“Every boardroom runs on three priorities: time, money, and legal risk. If you can’t translate cyber into those, you’ll stay on the sidelines.”\nBuild your brand outside the security bubble.\n“Board members are on multiple boards. The way in is through trust and reputation, not just technical excellence.”\nKurtz traced the path from regulatory reform to boardroom impact by revisiting how Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002 transformed CFOs into solid boardroom contributors. He argued that the SEC’s 2024 breach reporting mandate does the same for CISOs. “Threats drive regulation, and regulation drives board composition,” he said. “This is our moment.”\nHis advice wasn’t abstract. He urged CISOs to study proxy statements, identify committee-level needs and network strategically with board members who are “always looking to fill roles.” He pointed to CrowdStrike CISO Adam Zoller, now on the board of AdventHealth, as a model. Zoller, Kurtz says, is someone who earned his seat by staying in the room, learning how the board operated and being seen as more than a security expert.\nKurtz closed with a challenge: “I hope to come back in ten years, still with red hair, and see CISOs on 50% of boards, just like CFOs. The boardroom’s not waiting for permission. The only question is: will it be you?”\n“AI isn’t magic—It’s math”\nDiana Kelley, CTO of\nProtect AI\n, drew one of the most significant early crowds at RSAC 2025 with a blunt message: “AI isn’t magic—it’s math. And just as we secure software, we must rigorously secure the AI lifecycle.” Her keynote provided a sound background that sliced through gen AI hype, spotlighting the real risks to AI models that every organization needs to defend against before beginning any work on their models. Kelly provided in-depth insights into model poisoning, prompt injections and hallucinations, calling for a full-stack approach to AI security.\nShe introduced the OWASP Top 10 for gen AI, emphasizing the need to secure AI from day zero, partner with CISOs early, threat-model aggressively and treat prompts, outputs and agent chains as privileged attack surfaces.\nPalo Alto Networks announced\nits intent to acquire Protect AI\nthe same day as Kelley’s presentation, another factor driving\nso many conversations about her keynote.\nRSAC 2025 shows why it’s time for agentic AI to deliver results\nRSAC 2025 made one thing clear: AI agents are entering security workflows, but boards want proof they work. For CISOs under pressure to justify spending and reduce risk, the focus is shifting from innovation hype to operational impact. The real wins, including 40% lower dwell time and phishing resilience reaching 70%, came from platform consolidation and automating alert triage, which are all proven technologies and techniques. Agentic AI’s moment of truth is here, especially for vendors just entering the market.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The company recently reported at\nleast 500 million active weekly users of the hit web service.\nA quick primer on the terrible, no good, sycophantic GPT-4o update\nOpenAI began updating GPT-4o to a newer model it hoped would be more well-received by users on April 24th, completed the updated by April 25th, then, five days later,\nrolled it back on April 29\n, after days of mounting complaints of users across social media — mainly on X and Reddit.\nThe complaints varied in intensity and in specifics, but all generally coalesced around the fact that GPT-4o appeared to be responding to user queries with undue flattery, support for misguided, incorrect and downright harmful ideas, and “glazing” or praising the user to an excessive degree when it wasn’t actually specifically requested, much less warranted.\nIn examples screenshotted and posted by users, ChatGPT powered by that sycophantic, updated GPT-4o model had praised and endorsed a business idea for literal “shit on a stick,” applauded a user’s sample text of schizophrenic delusional isolation, and even allegedly supported plans to commit terrorism.\nUsers including\ntop AI researchers and even a former OpenAI interim CEO\nsaid they were concerned that an AI model’s unabashed cheerleading for these types of terrible user prompts was more than simply annoying or inappropriate — that it could cause actual harm to users who mistakenly believed the AI and felt emboldened by its support for their worst ideas and impulses. It rose to the level of an AI safety issue.\nOpenAI then released a blog post\ndescribing what went wrong — “we focused too much on short-term feedback, and did not fully account for how users’ interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time. As a result, GPT‑4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous” — and the steps the company was taking to address the issues. OpenAI’s Head of Model Behavior Joanne Jang also participated in a Reddit “Ask me anything” or AMA forum answering text posts from users and revealed further information about the company’s approach to GPT-4o and how it ended up with an excessively sycophantic model, including not “bak[ing] in enough nuance,” as to how it was incorporating user feedback such as “thumbs up” actions made by users in response to model outputs they liked.\nNow today,\nOpenAI has released a blog post\nwith even more information about how the sycophantic GPT-4o update happened — credited not to any particular author, but to “OpenAI.”\nCEO and co-founder Sam Altman also\nposted a link to the blog post on X,\nsaying: “we missed the mark with last week’s GPT-4o update. what happened, what we learned, and some things we will do differently in the future.”\nWhat the new OpenAI blog post reveals about how and why GPT-4o turned so sycophantic\nTo me, a daily user of ChatGPT including the 4o model, the most striking admission from OpenAI’s new blog post about the sycophancy update is how the company appears to reveal that it\ndid\nreceive concerns about the model prior to release from a small group of “expert testers,” but that it seemingly overrode those in favor of a broader enthusiastic response from a wider group of more general users.\nAs the company writes (emphasis mine):\n“While we’ve had discussions about risks related to sycophancy in GPT‑4o for a while, sycophancy wasn’t explicitly flagged as part of our internal hands-on testing, as some of our expert testers were more concerned about the change in the model’s tone and style. Nevertheless,\nsome expert testers had indicated that the model behavior “felt” slightly off…\n“\nWe then had a decision to make: should we withhold deploying this update despite positive evaluations and A/B test results, based only on the subjective flags of the expert testers?\nIn the end, we decided to launch the model due to the positive signals from the users who tried out the model.\n“\nUnfortunately, this was the wrong call.\nWe build these models for our users and while user feedback is critical to our decisions, it’s ultimately our responsibility to interpret that feedback correctly.”\nThis seems to me like a big mistake. Why even have expert testers if you’re not going to weight their expertise higher than the masses of the crowd?\nI asked Altman about this choice on X\nbut he has yet to respond.\nNot all ‘reward signals’ are equal\nOpenAI’s new post-mortem blog post also reveals more specifics about how the company trains and updates new versions of existing models, and how human feedback alters the model qualities, character, and “personality.” As the company writes:\n“Since launching GPT‑4o in ChatGPT last May, we’ve\nreleased five major updates\nfocused on changes to personality and helpfulness. Each update involves new post-training, and often many minor adjustments to the model training process are independently tested and then combined into a single updated model which is then evaluated for launch.\n“\nTo post-train models, we take a pre-trained base model, do supervised fine-tuning on a broad set of ideal responses written by humans or existing models, and then run reinforcement learning with reward signals from a variety of sources.\n“\nDuring reinforcement learning, we present the language model with a prompt and ask it to write responses. We then rate its response according to the reward signals, and update the language model to make it more likely to produce higher-rated responses and less likely to produce lower-rated responses.\n“\nClearly, the “reward signals” used by OpenAI during post-training have an enormous impact on the resulting model behavior, and as the company admitted earlier when it overweighted “thumbs up” responses from ChatGPT users to its outputs, this signal may not be the best one to use equally with others when determining\nhow\nthe model learns to communicate and\nwhat kinds\nof responses it should be serving up. OpenAI admits this outright in the next paragraph of its post, writing:\n“Defining the correct set of reward signals is a difficult question, and we take many things into account: are the answers correct, are they helpful, are they in line with our\nModel Spec\n⁠, are they safe, do users like them, and so on. Having better and more comprehensive reward signals produces better models for ChatGPT, so we’re always experimenting with new signals, but each one has its quirks.”\nIndeed, OpenAI also reveals the “thumbs up” reward signal was a new one used alongside other reward signals in this particular update.\n“the update introduced an additional reward signal based on user feedback—thumbs-up and thumbs-down data from ChatGPT. This signal is often useful; a thumbs-down usually means something went wrong.”\nYet critically, the company doesn’t blame the new “thumbs up” data outright for the model’s failure and ostentatious cheerleading behaviors. Instead, OpenAI’s blog post says it was this\ncombined\nwith a variety of other new and older reward signals, led to the problems:\n“…we had candidate improvements to better incorporate user feedback, memory, and fresher data, among others. Our early assessment is that each of these changes, which had looked beneficial individually, may have played a part in tipping the scales on sycophancy when combined.”\nReacting to this blog post, Andrew Mayne, a former member of the OpenAI technical staff now working at AI consulting firm Interdimensional,\nwrote on X of another example\nof how subtle changes in reward incentives and model guidelines can impact model performance quite dramatically:\n“\nEarly on at OpenAI, I had a disagreement with a colleague (who is now a founder of another lab) over using the word “polite” in a prompt example I wrote.\nThey argued “polite” was politically incorrect and wanted to swap it for “helpful.”\nI pointed out that focusing only on helpfulness can make a model overly compliant—so compliant, in fact, that it can be steered into sexual content within a few turns.\nAfter I demonstrated that risk with a simple exchange, the prompt kept “polite.”\nThese models are weird.\n“\nHow OpenAI plans to improve its model testing processes going forward\nThe company lists six process improvements for how to avoid similar undesirable and less-than-ideal model behavior in the future, but to me the most important is this:\n“We’ll adjust our safety review process to formally consider behavior issues—such as hallucination, deception, reliability, and personality—as blocking concerns. Even if these issues aren’t perfectly quantifiable today, we commit to blocking launches based on proxy measurements or qualitative signals, even when metrics like A/B testing look good.”\nIn other words — despite how important data, especially quantitative data, is to the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence — OpenAI recognizes that this alone can’t and should not be the only means by which a model’s performance is judged.\nWhile many users providing a “thumbs up” could signal a type of desirable behavior in the short term, the long term implications for how the AI model responds and where those behaviors take it and its users, could ultimately lead to a very dark, distressing, destructive, and undesirable place. More is not always better — especially when you are constraining the “more” to a few domains of signals.\nIt’s not enough to say that the model passed all of the tests or received a number of positive responses from users — the expertise of trained power users and their qualitative feedback that something “seemed off” about the model, even if they couldn’t fully express why, should carry much more weight than OpenAI was allocating previously.\nLet’s hope the company — and the entire field — learns from this incident and integrates the lessons going forward.\nBroader takeaways and considerations for enterprise decision-makers\nSpeaking perhaps more theoretically, for myself, it also indicates why expertise is so important — and specifically, expertise in fields\nbeyond\nand\noutside\nof the one you’re optimizing for (in this case, machine learning and AI). It’s the diversity of expertise that allows us as a species to achieve new advances that benefit our kind. One, say STEM, shouldn’t necessarily be held above the others in the humanities or arts.\nAnd finally, I also think it reveals at its heart a fundamental problem with using human feedback to design products and services. Individual users may say they like a more sycophantic AI based on each isolated interaction, just like they also may say they love the way fast food and soda tastes, the convenience of single-use plastic containers, the entertainment and connection they derive from social media, the worldview validation and tribalist belonging they feel when reading politicized media or tabloid gossip. Yet again, taken all together, the\ncumulation\nof all of these types of trends and activities often leads to very undesirable outcomes for individuals and society — obesity and poor health in the case of fast food, pollution and endocrine disruption in the case of plastic waste, depression and isolation from overindulgence of social media, a more splintered and less-informed body public from reading poor quality news sources.\nAI model designers and technical decision-makers at enterprises would do well to keep this broader idea in mind when designing metrics around any measurable goal — because even when you think you’re using data to your advantage, it could backfire in ways you didn’t fully expect or anticipate, leaving your scrambling to repair the damage and mop up the mess you made, however inadvertently.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Brazil is Roblox’s second biggest market worldwide by daily active users, having grown at an aggregate rate of 181% in four years.\nGamescom Latam Big Festival is being held this week in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\nHaving a data center in Brazil comes with a number of benefits, including:\nBetter frame rates, response times, and reduced jitter for players across the country\nAn improved experience for players enjoying high-fidelity, high-performance games\nSupport for all of Roblox’s cutting-edge developer tooling, enabling potentially more competitive, high-speed gameplay\nOptimized performance on both high-spec and lower-end devices due to reduced latency and improved load times\nA high-performance environment for creators’ games, growing creators’ Brazilian playerbase\nJerret West, chief marketing officer and head of international expansion at Roblox, said in a statement, “We’re excited to launch our new data center in Brazil, our most advanced yet. With cutting-edge hardware, we’re boosting performance and reliability for our Brazilian players and preparing to welcome millions more. Brazil is incredibly important to us, and we’re dedicated to building a more immersive and responsive platform for users here and beyond.”\nThe Roblox booth at Gamescom Latam, the day before the expo opened to fans.\nMatheus Vivian (a.k.a. Hermit Crab) is a Brazilian developer and creator who most recently worked with the Brazilian Olympics Committee and Menino Maluquinho to bring their activations to life on the Roblox platform.\nIn a statement, Vivian said, “As a Roblox developer based in Brazil, seeing Roblox invest in a cutting-edge data center right here is incredibly exciting. This move shows how seriously Roblox takes our community and our potential. Better infrastructure means faster load times, smoother gameplay, and more opportunities to build amazing experiences for Brazilian players and creators. It’s inspiring to see this kind of long-term commitment to our region. The future is bright for creators here.”\nThis announcement follows the\nlaunch of Regional Pricing\n, which allows creators to offer region-specific prices for their in-experience items. Creators who opt in to Regional Pricing now have an additional tool to build a global business and maximize earnings on Roblox.\nFor users, this means that prices in Robux are more reflective of their local economy, rather than paying the same price regardless of where they are. Later this year, the company plans to enable Regional Pricing for avatar items.\nFor more information, attendees of\ngamescom latam\ncan stop by the booth or sessions this week:\nBooth\nMay 1 – May 4\nBooth Numbers 2031 and 2033\nAt the booth, Roblox creators, players, and fans will have the chance to interact with their favorite Roblox influencers and developers, test games and experiences developed on the platform, and compete in development challenges, trivia, and skill-based gameplay matches.\nRoblox: Powering LATAM Game Development\nWhen:\nFriday, May 2 at 13:20\nWhere: Stage 1\nWhat:\nUnlock the full potential of your game development on Roblox.
