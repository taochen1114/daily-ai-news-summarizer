At last week’s\nRSAC 2025\nconference,\nCisco\n,\nMeta\nand\nProjectDiscovery\nannounced new open-source LLMs and a community-driven attack surface innovation that together define the future of open-source in cybersecurity.\nOne of the key takeaways from this year’s RSAC is the shift in open-source LLMs to extend and strengthen infrastructure at scale.\nOpen-source AI is on the verge of delivering what many cybersecurity leaders have called on for years, which is the ability of the many cybersecurity providers to join forces against increasingly complex threats. The vision of being collaborators in creating a unified, open-source LLM and infrastructure is a step closer, given the announcements at RSAC.\nCisco’s Chief Product Officer Jeetu Patel emphasized in his keynote, “The true enemy is not our competitor. It is actually the adversary. And we want to make sure that we can provide all kinds of tools and have the ecosystem band together so that we can actually collectively fight the adversary.”\nPatel explained the urgency of taking on such a complex challenge, saying, “AI is fundamentally changing everything, and cybersecurity is at the heart of it all. We’re no longer dealing with human-scale threats; these attacks are occurring at machine scale.”\nCisco’s Foundation-sec-8B LLM defines a new era of open-source AI\nCisco’s newly established\nFoundation AI group\noriginates from the company’s recent acquisition of\nRobust Intelligence\n. Foundation AI’s focus is on delivering domain-specific AI infrastructure tailored explicitly to cybersecurity applications, which are among the most challenging to solve. Built on Meta’s Llama 3.1 architecture, this 8-billion parameter, open-weight Large Language Model isn’t a retrofitted general-purpose AI. It was purpose-built, meticulously trained on a cybersecurity-specific dataset curated in-house by Cisco Foundation AI.\n“By their nature, the problems in this charter are some of the most difficult ones in AI today. To make the technology accessible, we decided that most of the work we do in Foundation AI should be open. Open innovation allows for compounding effects across the industry, and it plays a particularly important role in the cybersecurity domain,”\nwrites\nYaron Singer, VP of AI and Security at Foundation.\nWith open-source anchoring Foundation AI, Cisco has designed an efficient architectural approach for cybersecurity providers who typically compete with each other, selling comparable solutions, to become collaborators in creating more unified, hardened defenses.\nSinger\nwrites\n, “Whether you’re embedding it into existing tools or building entirely new workflows, foundation-sec-8b adapts to your organization’s unique needs.”\nCisco’s blog post\nannouncing the model recommends that security teams apply foundation-sec-8b across the security lifecycle. Potential use cases Cisco recommends for the model include SOC acceleration, proactive threat defense, engineering enablement, AI-assisted code reviews, validating configurations and custom integration.\nFoundation-sec-8B’s weights and tokenizer have been open-sourced under the permissive Apache 2.0 license on\nHugging Face\n, allowing enterprise-level customization and deployment without vendor lock-in, maintaining compliance and privacy controls.\nCisco’s blog also notes plans to open-source the training pipeline\n, further fostering community-driven innovation.\nCybersecurity is in the LLM’s DNA\nCisco chose to create a cybersecurity-specific model optimized for the needs of SOC, DevSecOps and large-scale security teams. Retrofitting an existing, generic AI model wouldn’t get them to their goal, so the Foundation AI team engineered its training using a large-scale, expansive and well-curated cybersecurity-specific dataset.\nBy taking a more precision-focused approach to building the model, the Foundation AI team was able to ensure that the model deeply understands real-world cyber threats, vulnerabilities and defensive strategies.\nKey training datasets included the following:\nVulnerability Databases:\nIncluding detailed CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and CWEs (Common Weakness Enumerations) to pinpoint known threats and weaknesses.\nThreat Behavior Mappings:\nStructured from proven security frameworks such as\nMITRE ATT&CK\n, providing context on attacker methodologies and behaviors.\nThreat Intelligence Reports:\nComprehensive insights derived from global cybersecurity events and emerging threats.\nRed-Team Playbooks:\nTactical plans outlining real-world adversarial techniques and penetration strategies.\nReal-World Incident Summaries:\nDocumented analyses of cybersecurity breaches, incidents, and their mitigation paths.\nCompliance and Security Guidelines:\nEstablished best practices from leading standards bodies, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (\nNIST\n) frameworks and the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (\nOWASP\n) secure coding principles.\nThis tailored training regimen positions Foundation-sec-8B uniquely to excel at complex cybersecurity tasks, offering significantly enhanced accuracy, deeper contextual understanding and quicker threat response capabilities than general-purpose alternatives.\nBenchmarking Foundation-sec-8B LLM\nCisco’s technical benchmarks show Foundation-sec-8B delivers cybersecurity performance comparable to significantly larger models:\nBenchmark\nFoundation-sec-8B\nLlama-3.1-8B\nLlama-3.1-70B\nCTI-MCQA\n67.39\n64.14\n68.23\nCTI-RCM\n75.26\n66.43\n72.66\nBy designing the foundation model to be cybersecurity-specific, Cisco is enabling SOC teams to gain greater efficiency with advanced threat analytics without having to pay high infrastructure costs to get it.\nCisco’s broader strategic vision, detailed in its blog,\nFoundation AI: Robust Intelligence for Cybersecurity,\naddresses common AI integration challenges, including limited domain alignment of general-purpose models, insufficient datasets and legacy system integration difficulties. Foundation-sec-8B is specifically designed to navigate these barriers, running efficiently on minimal hardware configurations, typically requiring just one or two\nNvidia\nA100 GPUs.\nMeta expands open-source AI security with AI Defenders suite\nMeta also underscored its open-source strategy at RSAC 2025, expanding its AI Defenders Suite to strengthen security across generative AI infrastructure. Their open-source toolkit now includes\nL\nl\nama Guard 4,\na multimodal classifier detecting policy violations across text and images, improving compliance monitoring within AI workflows.\nAlso introduced is\nLlamaF\nirewall,\nan open-source, real-time security framework integrating modular capabilities that includes\nPromptGuard 2\n, which is used to detect prompt injections and jailbreak attempts. Also launched as part of LlamaFirewall are\nAgent Alignment Checks\nthat monitor and protect AI agent decision-making processes along with\nCodeShield\n, which is designed to inspect generated code to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.\nMeta also enhanced Prompt Guard 2, offering two open-source variants that further strengthen the future of open-source AI-based infrastructure. They include a high-accuracy 86M-parameter model and a leaner, lower-latency 22M-parameter alternative optimized for minimal resource use.\nAdditionally, Meta launched the open-source benchmarking suite\nCyberSec Eval 4\n, which was developed in partnership with CrowdStrike. It features\nCyberSOC Eval\n, benchmarking AI effectiveness in realistic Security Operations Center (SOC) scenarios and\nAutoPatchBench\n, which is used to evaluate autonomous AI capabilities for identifying and fixing software vulnerabilities.\nMeta also launched the Llama Defenders Program, which provides early access to open-AI-based security tools, including sensitive-document classifiers and audio threat detection. Private Processing is a privacy-first, on-device AI piloted within WhatsApp.\nProjectDiscovery’s Nuclei: Community-Driven, open-source security innovation\nAt RSAC 2025, ProjectDiscovery won the award for the “Most Innovative Startup” in the Innovation Sandbox, highlighting its commitment to open-source cybersecurity. Its flagship tool,\nNu\nc\nlei,\nis a customizable, open-source vulnerability scanner driven by a global community that rapidly identifies vulnerabilities across APIs, websites, cloud environments and networks.\nNuclei’s extensive YAML-based templating library\nincludes over 11,000 detection patterns, 3,000 directly tied to specific CVEs, enabling real-time threat identification. Andy Cao, COO at ProjectDiscovery, emphasized open-source’s strategic importance,\nstating\n: “Winning the 20th annual RSAC Innovation Sandbox proves open-source models can succeed in cybersecurity. It reflects the power of our community-driven approach to democratizing security.”\nProjectDiscovery’s success aligns with\nGartner’s 2024 Hype Cycle for Open-Source Software\n, which positions open-source AI and cybersecurity tools in the “Innovation Trigger” phase. Gartner recommends that organizations establish open-source program offices (OSPOs), adopt software bill-of-materials (SBOM) frameworks, and ensure regulatory compliance through effective governance practices.\nActionable insights for security leaders\nCisco’s Foundation-sec-8B, Meta’s expanded AI Defenders Suite and ProjectDiscovery’s Nuclei together demonstrated that cybersecurity innovation thrives most when openness, collaboration and specialized domain expertise align across company boundaries. These companies and others like them are setting the stage for any cybersecurity provider to be an active collaborator in creating cybersecurity defenses that deliver greater efficacy at lower costs.\nAs Patel emphasized during his keynote, “These aren’t fantasies. These are real-life examples that will be delivered because we now have bespoke security models that will be affordable for everyone. Better security efficacy is going to come at a fraction of the cost with state-of-the-art reasoning.”\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

As the generative AI era wears on, the Santa Clara-based company has also been steadily releasing more and more of its own AI models — mostly open source and free for researchers and developers to take, download, modify and use commercially — and the latest among them is\nParakeet-TDT-0.6B-v2\n, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that can, in\nthe words of Hugging Face’s Vaibhav “VB” Srivastav,\n“transcribe 60 minutes of audio in 1 second [mind blown emoji].”\nThis is the new generation of the Parakeet model Nvidia first unveiled back in January 2024 and updated again in\nApril of that year\n, but this version two is so powerful, it currently tops the\nHugging Face Open ASR Leaderboard\nwith an average “Word Error Rate” (times the model incorrectly transcribes a spoken word) of just 6.05% (out of 100).\nTo put that in perspective, it nears proprietary transcription models such as\nOpenAI’s GPT-4o-transcribe\n(with a WER of 2.46% in English) and\nElevenLabs Scribe\n(3.3%).\nAnd it’s offering all this while remaining freely available under a commercially permissive\nCreative Commons CC-BY-4.0 license\n, making it an attractive proposition for commercial enterprises and indie developers looking to build speech recognition and transcription services into their paid applications.\nPerformance and benchmark standing\nThe model boasts 600 million parameters and leverages a combination of the FastConformer encoder and TDT decoder architectures.\nIt is capable of transcribing an hour of audio in just one second, provided it’s running on Nvidia’s GPU-accelerated hardware.\nThe performance benchmark is measured at an RTFx (Real-Time Factor) of 3386.02 with a batch size of 128, placing it at the top of current ASR benchmarks maintained by Hugging Face.\nUse cases and availability\nReleased globally on May 1, 2025, Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v2 is aimed at developers, researchers, and industry teams building applications such as transcription services, voice assistants, subtitle generators, and conversational AI platforms.\nThe model supports punctuation, capitalization, and detailed word-level timestamping, offering a full transcription package for a wide range of speech-to-text needs.\nAccess and deployment\nDevelopers can deploy the model using Nvidia’s NeMo toolkit. The setup process is compatible with Python and PyTorch, and the model can be used directly or fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks.\nThe open-source license (CC-BY-4.0) also allows for commercial use, making it appealing to startups and enterprises alike.\nTraining data and model development\nParakeet-TDT-0.6B-v2 was trained on a diverse and large-scale corpus called the Granary dataset. This includes around 120,000 hours of English audio, composed of 10,000 hours of high-quality human-transcribed data and 110,000 hours of pseudo-labeled speech.\nSources range from well-known datasets like LibriSpeech and Mozilla Common Voice to YouTube-Commons and Librilight.\nNvidia plans to make the Granary dataset publicly available following its presentation at Interspeech 2025.\nEvaluation and robustness\nThe model was evaluated across multiple English-language ASR benchmarks, including AMI, Earnings22, GigaSpeech, and SPGISpeech, and showed strong generalization performance. It remains robust under varied noise conditions and performs well even with telephony-style audio formats, with only modest degradation at lower signal-to-noise ratios.\nHardware compatibility and efficiency\nParakeet-TDT-0.6B-v2 is optimized for Nvidia GPU environments, supporting hardware such as the A100, H100, T4, and V100 boards.\nWhile high-end GPUs maximize performance, the model can still be loaded on systems with as little as 2GB of RAM, allowing for broader deployment scenarios.\nEthical considerations and responsible use\nNVIDIA notes that the model was developed without the use of personal data and adheres to its responsible AI framework.\nAlthough no specific measures were taken to mitigate demographic bias, the model passed internal quality standards and includes detailed documentation on its training process, dataset provenance, and privacy compliance.\nThe release drew attention from the machine learning and open-source communities, especially after being publicly highlighted on social media. Commentators noted the model’s ability to outperform commercial ASR alternatives while remaining fully open source and commercially usable.\nDevelopers interested in trying the model can access it via\nHugging Face\nor through Nvidia’s NeMo toolkit. Installation instructions, demo scripts, and integration guidance are readily available to facilitate experimentation and deployment.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The system, called\nVisa Intelligent Commerce\n, was unveiled last Wednesday at the company’s Global Product Drop event in San Francisco and enables AI assistants to not only recommend products but complete transactions.\n“Soon people will have AI agents browse, select, purchase, and manage on their behalf,” said Jack Forestell, Visa’s Chief Product and Strategy Officer, during the announcement. “These agents will need to be trusted with payments, not only by users, but by banks and sellers as well.”\nThe initiative is built on a network of partnerships with leading AI companies including\nAnthropic\n,\nIBM\n,\nMicrosoft\n,\nMistral AI\n,\nOpenAI\n,\nPerplexity\n,\nSamsung\n, and\nStripe\n, among others. This collaboration aims to embed payment capabilities directly into AI systems that are already transforming how consumers discover products and services.\nAI shopping assistants move beyond product discovery to complete purchases\nVisa’s new platform addresses a critical gap in the current AI commerce landscape. While AI systems have become increasingly sophisticated at helping users find products, they typically hit a wall when it comes to completing transactions.\n“AI commerce is a new commerce experience where AI agents play an active role in helping users shop online,” explained Rubail Birwadker, SVP and Head of Growth, Products & Partnerships at Visa, in an interview with VentureBeat. “Today, agents help largely with product discovery, but with Visa Intelligent Commerce they will start to transact on behalf of users.”\nThe system works by replacing traditional card details with tokenized digital credentials that can be securely accessed by authorized AI agents. Users maintain control by setting specific parameters, such as spending limits and merchant categories, while the AI handles the transaction details.\nFor example, a consumer could instruct their AI assistant to book a flight to Cancún under $500, order weekly groceries, or find the perfect gift for a family member. The AI would search across multiple sites, compare options, and complete the purchase — all without requiring the consumer to manually enter payment information at each step.\n“There is tremendous potential for the role AI agents will play across a wide variety of commerce use cases, from everyday tasks such as ordering groceries, to more sophisticated search and decision-making like booking vacations,” Birwadker noted.\nHow Visa plans to make AI transactions secure in an era of digital fraud\nThe announcement comes at a time when concerns about AI security and data privacy remain high among consumers. Visa appears to have anticipated these concerns by making security a central feature of the platform.\n“Visa takes an intelligence-driven approach to understanding new and novel fraud and cybercrime threats against emerging technology,” Birwadker said. “Just like we identified, researched and built controls and best practices for using generative AI, Visa is also committed to identifying, researching and mitigating threat actor activity targeting agentic commerce.”\nThe company is leveraging its decades of experience in fraud detection and prevention, with executives noting that Visa’s AI and machine learning systems blocked approximately\n$40 billion in fraud\nlast year alone.\nThe system includes several key security components. The\nAI-Ready Cards\nreplace traditional card details with tokenized credentials, enhancing security while simplifying the payment process. The platform also implements identity verification, confirming that a consumer’s chosen AI agent is authorized to act on their behalf. “Only the consumer can instruct the agent on what to do and when to activate a payment credential,” the company emphasized. Additionally, transactions generate signals that are shared with Visa in real-time, enabling the company to enforce transaction controls and assist with dispute management.\n“Transactions made by an AI agent will be tokenized, meaning the card details are replaced,” Birwadker explained. “For personalization, Visa uses a data privacy-preserving framework. Data requests are managed through data tokens, which allows for consent management and control by the consumer, payment credential tokenization for the purpose of data sharing, and secure and encrypted transmission of data.”\nPersonalized shopping with guardrails: How Consumers Keep Control of AI Spending\nA distinguishing feature of Visa’s approach is the emphasis on user control. Consumers can set spending limits, specify merchant categories, and even require real-time approval for certain transactions.\nMark Nelsen, Visa’s global head of consumer products,\ntold PYMNTS\nthat the system allows consumers to set parameters such as a “$500 ceiling for a hotel or an airline ticket.” The AI agent then works within these constraints, finding options that meet the consumer’s criteria without exceeding preset limits.\n“For personalization, Visa uses a data privacy-preserving framework,” Birwadker told VentureBeat. “Data requests are managed through data tokens, which allows for consent management and control by the consumer, payment credential tokenization for the purpose of data sharing, and secure and encrypted transmission of data.”\nThis approach reflects Visa’s understanding that consumer adoption hinges on maintaining a sense of agency while delegating shopping tasks to AI. The company has carefully designed a system where convenience doesn’t come at the expense of control.\nVisa positions itself at the center of AI commerce revolution with 200-country network\nThe announcement represents Visa’s effort to position itself at the center of what could become the next major shift in how consumers shop online — potentially as significant as the transitions from physical to digital shopping and from desktop to mobile commerce.\n“Just like the shift from physical shopping to online, and from online to mobile, Visa is setting a new standard for a new era of commerce,” Forestell said. “Now, with Visa Intelligent Commerce, AI agents can find, shop and buy for consumers based on their pre-selected preferences.”\nIndustry analysts note that Visa’s global footprint — spanning more than 200 countries and territories — gives it a significant advantage in scaling this technology. The company’s existing tokenization framework and merchant relationships provide the infrastructure needed to make AI commerce viable on a global scale.\nWhen asked about adoption timelines, Birwadker expressed confidence in the technology’s future: “AI adoption is real and the numbers prove it. When you see metrics like OpenAI topping 400 million users and other GenAI platforms building their audiences, it’s hard to imagine AI commerce not catching up. Visa Intelligent Commerce is a critical step and building block for the industry to start form and help create widespread adoption.”\nThe company indicated that developers can begin implementing the APIs immediately, with pilot programs expected to launch in the coming months.\nTrust remains a key challenge for consumers giving AI access to financial data\nDespite the enthusiasm from Visa and its partners, some consumers and privacy advocates remain skeptical about giving AI agents access to payment information. The company appears to be taking a measured approach to address these concerns.\nVisa’s system allows consumers to start with small, low-risk transactions before granting their AI assistants greater purchasing authority. The company emphasizes that consumers retain the same protections and fraud safeguards they currently have with their Visa cards, even when transactions are initiated by AI agents.\nThe extensive partnerships Visa has developed for this initiative demonstrate its commitment to building a comprehensive ecosystem rather than an isolated product. “We’re working with each of the partners you mentioned to bring better commerce experiences to consumers,” Birwadker told us. “For example, with OpenAI we’re enabling agentic commerce securely and safely at scale. And those aren’t the only ones we’re working with – we’re currently with more than 20 payment service providers and AI infrastructure enablers on this program.”\nAI shopping assistants could end the era of abandoned shopping carts\nVisa’s announcement comes amid growing competition in the AI commerce space. Several technology companies and financial institutions are exploring ways to integrate AI into the shopping experience, though few have unveiled comprehensive solutions that bridge product discovery and payment.\nWhat distinguishes Visa’s approach is the focus on embedding payment capabilities directly into the AI agents that consumers are already using for other tasks. Rather than creating a separate shopping assistant, Visa is opening its payment rails to existing AI platforms, potentially accelerating adoption.\nThis strategy also addresses the current fragmentation in online shopping, where consumers often need to create accounts and enter payment information across multiple sites and apps. By allowing AI agents to handle these transactions seamlessly, Visa aims to reduce cart abandonment and simplify the commerce experience.\n“Unlike existing e-commerce, which places the task on consumers to search and transact, Visa Intelligent Commerce will enable seamless and scalable transactions through autonomous agents,” Birwadker said.\nFrom Cashiers to Algorithms: The Future of Shopping Has AI at the Checkout\nAs Visa prepares to roll out its Intelligent Commerce platform, the boundaries between human and artificial decision-making continue to blur in the commerce landscape. For decades, we’ve entrusted humans—from retail clerks to travel agents—with our shopping needs. Now we stand at the threshold of trusting algorithms with not just our product searches, but our wallets as well.\nThe ultimate success of Visa’s initiative will depend not on the technology itself, which is increasingly capable, but on the psychological shift it requires from consumers. People who grew up memorizing credit card numbers and guarding them closely must now decide whether the convenience of AI-powered shopping outweighs ingrained caution about financial data.\nThroughout history, shoppers have always adapted to new ways to buy — from marketplace haggling to department stores, from mail-order catalogs to e-commerce — each transition has required consumers to place their trust in new systems.\nVisa’s AI commerce initiative asks for perhaps the most profound trust leap yet: allowing an artificial agent to not only know what we want but to spend our money acquiring it. As shoppers face this choice, they’re not just evaluating a new technology. They’re deciding whether to outsource the final human element in commerce — the decision to buy.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
