According to Patronus, early customers have reduced the time spent analyzing agent workflows from about one hour to between one and 1.5 minutes.\nTRAIL benchmark reveals critical gaps in AI oversight capabilities\nAlongside the product launch, Patronus is releasing a benchmark called\nTRAIL (Trace Reasoning and Agentic Issue Localization)\nto evaluate how well systems can detect issues in AI agent workflows.\nResearch using\nthis benchmark\nrevealed that even sophisticated AI models struggle with effective trace analysis, with the best-performing system scoring only 11% on the benchmark.\nThe findings underscore the challenging nature of monitoring complex AI systems and may help explain why large enterprises are investing in specialized tools for AI oversight.\nEnterprise AI leaders embrace Percival for mission-critical agent applications\nEarly adopters include\nEmergence AI\n, which has raised approximately\n$100 million in funding\nand is developing systems where AI agents can create and manage other agents.\n“Emergence’s recent breakthrough—agents creating agents—marks a pivotal moment not only in the evolution of adaptive, self-generating systems, but also in how such systems are governed and scaled responsibly,” said Satya Nitta, co-founder and CEO of Emergence AI, in a statement sent to VentureBeat.\nNova, another early customer, is using the technology for a platform that helps large enterprises migrate legacy code through AI-powered SAP integrations.\nThese customers typify the challenge Percival aims to solve. According to Kannappan, some companies are now managing agent systems with “more than 100 steps in a single agent directory,” creating complexity that far exceeds what human operators can efficiently monitor.\nAI oversight market poised for explosive growth as autonomous systems proliferate\nThe launch comes amid rising enterprise concerns about AI reliability and governance. As companies deploy increasingly autonomous systems, the need for oversight tools has grown proportionally.\n“What’s challenging is that systems are becoming increasingly autonomous,” Kannappan noted, adding that “billions of lines of code are being generated per day using AI,” creating an environment where manual oversight becomes practically impossible.\nThe market for AI monitoring and reliability tools is expected to expand significantly as enterprises move from experimental deployments to mission-critical AI applications.\nPercival integrates with multiple AI frameworks, including Hugging Face\nSmolagents\n,\nPydantic AI\n,\nOpenAI Agent SDK\n, and\nLangchain\n, making it compatible with various development environments.\nWhile\nPatronus AI\ndid not disclose pricing or revenue projections, the company’s focus on enterprise-grade oversight suggests it is positioning itself for the high-margin enterprise AI safety market that analysts predict will grow substantially as AI adoption accelerates.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Right now, Notion only supports GPT-4.1 and Claude 3.7. The idea is to reduce window and context switching.\nThe company said early adopters of the new feature include OpenAI, Ramp, Vercel and Harvey.\nModel mixing and fine-tuning\nNotion built the features with a mix of LLMs from OpenAI and Claude, and its own models.\nThe move away from pure reasoning models makes the model choice interesting for Notion. GPT-4.1 is technically not a reasoning model, while Claude 3.7 is a hybrid model— capable of acting as a regular LLM and a reasoning model.\nReasoning models are having a moment, though many warn that these models can\nstill sometimes lie\n. However, while reasoning models like OpenAI’s o3 (and yes, Claude 3.7 Sonnet) take their time to answer, going through different scenarios, they are not the best for quick thinking and data-gathering tasks. Many productivity tasks, like meeting transcriptions or searches for task data, don’t need the power of a reasoning model behind them.\nSarah Sachs, Notion AI Engineering Lead, told VentureBeat in an email that the company aimed for features that didn’t sacrifice accuracy, safety and privacy, along with responding to queries in the speed enterprises need.\n“In order to achieve a low-latency experience, we fine-tuned the models with internal usage and feedback from trusted testers, in order to make the AI specialized in Notion retrieval tasks,” Sachs said. “This setup helps Notion AI understand business needs, give relevant answers, serve customers with sub-second latency, and keep customer data safe and compliant.”\nSachs said hosting and building with different models allows users to “pick the option that best fits their needs— whether that’s a more conversational tone, better coding capabilities, or faster response times.”\nAI meeting notes and more\nNotion AI for Work tracks and transcribes meetings for users, especially if they added Notion to their calendar, and it can listen in on calls.\nUsers can use Notion for enterprise search by connecting apps like Slack, Microsoft Teams, GitHub, Google Drive, Sharepoint and Gmail. Sachs said Notion AI will search an organization’s internal documents, databases and the connected apps.\nThe enterprise search results, along with other uploaded documents or a web search, allow Notion users to access the new Research Mode. It will draft documents directly from Notion while “analyzing all of your sources—plus the web—and think through the best response.”\nNotion also added both GPT-4.1 and Claude 3.7 as chat options. OpenAI noted that Notion users can chat with GPT-4.1 on the workspace and create a Notion template directly from the conversation. Sachs said the company is working on adding more models to its chat feature.\nGPT-4.1 is now built into Notion!\nYou can ask GPT-4.1 to help with anything, then create a Notion page directly from the convo.\n(btw GPT-4.1's output in this video wasn't sped up.)\nhttps://t.co/RMivVBMuEr\npic.twitter.com/PVrZPUpWrf\n— edwin (@edwinarbus)\nMay 13, 2025\nSubscribers to Notion’s Business and Enterprise plans with the Notion AI add-on get immediate access to the new features.\nCompete with the model providers\nEven though Notion users can access both Anthropic and OpenAI on the platform, Notion still has to compete with model providers.\nOpenAI’s Deep Research has been\nhailed as a game-changer\nfor agentic retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Google also has its\nversion of Deep Research\n. And Anthropic can\nsearch the internet\nfor you.\nNot to mention, Notion needs to compete with other platforms that already leverage AI. The meeting space is\nchock full of companies\ntracking, transcribing, summarizing and pulling insights from calls with AI.\nHowever, Notion’s big selling point is that it has all these capabilities on one single platform. Enterprises can use all those different services but live outside their chosen productivity platform. Notion said having all of these features in one place, with one\nall-in-one pricing\n, will save enterprises from subscribing to different platforms.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Insider threats are growing, too, accelerated by job insecurity and growing inflation. All these challenges and more fall on the shoulders of the CISO, and it’s no wonder more are dealing with burnout.\nIn\nPart 1\n:\nWe explored how gen AI is reshaping the threat landscape, accelerating insider threats and putting unprecedented pressure on cybersecurity teams. Insider-driven risks, shadow AI usage and outdated detection models are forcing CISOs to rethink their defenses.\nNow, in Part 2, we turn to the solutions — how gen AI can help combat burnout across security operations centers (SOCs), enable smarter automation and guide CISOs through a 90-day roadmap to secure their enterprises against evolving threats.\nBattling burnout with gen AI deserves to be a 2025 CISO priority\nNearly\none in four CISOs\nconsider quitting, with\n93%\nciting extreme stress, further proving that burnout is creating increasingly severe operational and human risks.\nGartner’s\nmost recent research links burnout to decreased team efficiency and overlooked security tasks that often become vulnerabilities. Unsurprisingly,\n90%\nof CISOs identify burnout as one of the main barriers that stand in the way of their teams getting more accomplished and using the full extent of their skills.\nHow bad is burnout across cybersecurity and SOC teams? The majority of CISOs,\n65%\n, say that burnout is a severe impediment to maintaining effective security operations.\nForrester\nadds that\n36%\nof the cybersecurity workforce are categorized as “Tired Rockstars,” or individuals who remain highly engaged but are on the brink of burnout. This emphasizes the critical need to address mental health and workload management proactively.​\nSOC analysts\nendur\ne heavy workloads that often turn severe when they have to monitor, analyze and aggregate insights from an average of over 10,000+ alerts a day. Chronic stress and not having enough control over their jobs lead to high turnover, with 65% considering leaving their careers.\nIvanti’s 2024 Digital Employee Experience (DEX) Report\nunderscores a vital cybersecurity link, noting that 93% of professionals agree improved DEX strengthens security, yet just 13% prioritize it. Ivanti SVP Daren Goeson told VentureBeat in a recent interview that “organizations often lack effective tools to measure digital employee experience, significantly slowing security and productivity initiatives.”\nSOC teams are particularly hard hit by burnout. While AI can’t solve the entire challenge, it can help automate SOC workflows and accelerate triage. Forrester is urging CISOs to think beyond automating existing processes and move forward with rationalizing security controls, deploying gen AI within existing platforms. Jeff Pollard, VP at Forrester,\nwrites\n: “The only way to deal with the volatility your organization encounters is to simplify your control stack while identifying unnecessary duplicate spend and gen AI can boost productivity, but negotiating its pricing strategically will help you achieve more with less.”\nThere are over 16 vendors of new-gen AI-based apps aimed at helping SOC teams that are in a race against time every day, especially when it comes to containing breakout times.\nCrowdStrike’s\nrecent global threat report\nemphasizes why SOCs need to always have their A-game, as adversaries now break out within 2 minutes and 7 seconds after gaining initial access. Their recent introduction of\nCharlotte AI Detection Triage\nhas proven capable of automating alert assessment with over 98% accuracy. It cuts manual triage by more than\n40 hours per week\n, all without losing control or precision. SOCs\nincreasingly\nlean\non AI copilots to fight signal overload\nand staffing shortfalls. VentureBeat’s Security\nCopilot Guide (Google Sheet)\nprovides a complete matrix with 16 vendors’ AI security copilots.\nWhat needs to be on every CISO’s roadmap in 2025\nCybersecurity leaders and their teams have significant influence on how, when\nand what gen AI applications and platforms th\neir enterprises invest in. Gartner’s Phillip Shattan\nwrites\nthat “when it comes to generation AI-related decisions, SRM leaders wield significant influence, with over 70% reporting that cybersecurity has some influence over the decisions they make.”\nWith so much influence on the future of gen AI investment in their organizations, CISOs need to have a solid framework or roadmap against which to plan. VentureBeat is seeing more roadmaps comparable to the one structured below for ensuring the integration of gen AI, cybersecurity and risk management initiatives. The following is a guideline that needs to be tailored to the unique needs of a business:\nDays 0–30: Establish core cybersecurity foundations\n1. Set the goal of defining the structure and role of an AI governance framework\nDefine formal AI policies outlining responsible data use, model training protocols, privacy controls and ethical standards.\nVendors to consider: IBM AI Governance, Microsoft Purview, ServiceNow AI Governance, AWS AI Service Cards\nIf not already in place, deploy real-time AI monitoring tools to detect unauthorized usage, anomalous behaviors and data leakage from models.\nRecommended platforms: Robust Intelligence, CalypsoAI, HiddenLayer, Arize AI, Credo AI, Arthur AI\nTrain SOC, security and risk management teams on the AI-specific risks to alleviate any conflicts over how AI governance frameworks are designed to work.\n2. If not already in place, get a solid Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform in place\nKeep building a business case for zero trust by illustrating how improving identity protection\nhelps protect and grow revenue.\nDeploy a robust IAM solution to reinforce identity protection and revenue security.\nTop IAM platforms:\nOkta Identity Cloud, Microsoft Entra ID, CyberArk Identity, ForgeRock, Ping Identity, SailPoint Identity Platform, Ivanti Identity Director.\nIf not already done, immediately conduct comprehensive audits of all user identities, focusing particularly on privileged access accounts. Enable real-time monitoring for all privileged access accounts and delete unused accounts for contractors.\nImplement strict least-privilege access policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA) and continuous adaptive authentication based on contextual risk assessments to\nstrengthen your zero-trust framework.\nLeading Zero-Trust solutions include CrowdStrike Falcon Identity Protection, Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, Palo Alto Networks Prisma Access, Cisco Duo Security and\nCloudflare Zero Trust.\nEstablish real-time monitoring and behavioral analytics to identify and reduce insider threats rapidly.\nInsider threat detection leaders: Proofpoint Insider Threat Management, Varonis DatAdvantage, Forcepoint Insider Threat, DTEX Systems, Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management.\nDays 31–60: Accelerate Proactive Security Operations\n1. Replace manual patch workflows with an automated patch management systems\nYour organization needs to move beyond fire drills and severity-based patch cycles to a continuous, real-time vulnerability monitoring and patch deployment strategy.\nAI is helping cut the risks of breaches\nwith patch management. Six in ten\nbreaches\nare linked to unpatched vulnerabilities. The majority of IT leaders responding to a\nPonemon Institute survey\n, 60%, say that one or more of the breaches potentially occurred because a patch was available for a known vulnerability but not applied in time.\nLeading automated patch management vendors: Ivanti Neurons for Patch Management, Qualys Patch Management, Tanium Patch Management, CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight, Rapid7 InsightVM.\nImplement automated tools prioritizing patches based on active exploitation, threat intelligence insights and business-critical asset prioritization.\nEstablish transparent processes for immediate response to emerging threats, drastically reducing exposure windows.\n2. Initiate comprehensive Cyber Risk Quantification (CRQ)\nIf not already in progress in your organization, start evaluating the value of CRQ frameworks in improving how cybersecurity risks are measured and communicated in financial and business impact terms.\nTrusted CRQ solutions: BitSight, SecurityScorecard, Axio360, RiskLens, MetricStream, Safe Security, IBM Security Risk Quantification Services.\nTest out a CRQ by creating a detailed risk dashboard for executives and stakeholders, linking cybersecurity investments directly to strategic business outcomes.\nConduct regular CRQ assessments to inform proactive security spending and resource allocation decisions clearly and strategically.\nDays 61–90: Keep optimizing security efficiency to fuel greater team resilience\n1. Consolidate and Integrate Security Tools\nAudit existing cybersecurity tools, eliminating redundancies and streamlining capabilities into fewer, fully integrated platforms.\nComprehensive integrated platforms: Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR, Microsoft Sentinel, CrowdStrike Falcon Platform, Splunk Security Cloud, Cisco SecureX, Trellix XDR, Arctic Wolf Security Operations Cloud.\nCheck for strong interoperability and reliable integration among cybersecurity tools to improve threat detection, response times and overall operational efficiency.\nRegularly review and adjust consolidated toolsets based on evolving threat landscapes and organizational security needs.\n2. Implement structured burnout mitigation and automation\nStarting in the SOC, leverage AI-driven automation to offload repetitive cybersecurity tasks, including triage, log analysis, vulnerability scanning and initial threat triage, significantly reducing manual workloads.\nRecommended SOC automation tools: CrowdStrike Falcon Fusion, SentinelOne Singularity XDR, Microsoft Defender & Copilot, Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR, Ivanti Neurons for Security Operations\nEstablish structured recovery protocols, mandating cooldown periods and rotation schedules after major cybersecurity incidents to reduce analyst fatigue.\nDefine a balanced, regular cadence of ongoing cybersecurity training, mental well-being initiatives, and institutionalized burnout mitigation practices to sustain long-term team resilience and efficiency.\nAutomation and burnout mitigation vendors: Tines, Torq.io, Swimlane, Chronicle Security Operations Suite (Google Cloud), LogicHub SOAR+, Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR\nConclusion\nWith modest budget and headcount increases, CISOs and their teams are being called to defend more threat vectors than ever. Many tell VentureBeat it’s a continual balancing act that demands more time, training, and trade-offs on which legacy apps stay and which go, all defining how their future tech stack will look. CISOs who see gen AI as a strategic technology that can help unify and close gaps in security infrastructure are thorough in their vetting of new apps and tools before they go into production.\nWhile gen AI continues to fuel new adversarial AI techniques and tradecraft, cybersecurity vendors respond by accelerating the development of next-generation products. Paradoxically, the more advanced threatcraft becomes with adversarial AI, the more critical it becomes for defenders adopting AI to pursue and perfect human-in-the-middle designs that can flex and adapt to changing threats.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
