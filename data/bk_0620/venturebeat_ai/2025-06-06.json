Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the I/O edition is the company’s best coding model yet.\nBut this new preview, called Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 Thinking, is even better than the I/O edition. The stable version Google plans to release publicly is “ready for enterprise-scale capabilities.”\nThe I/O edition, or gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, was first made available to developers and enterprises in May through Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 Thinking can be accessed via the same platforms.\nPerformance metrics\nThis new version of Gemini 2.5 Pro performs even better than the first release.\nGoogle said the new version of Gemini 2.5 Pro improved by 24 points in LMArena and by 35 points in WebDevArena, where it currently tops the leaderboard. The company’s benchmark tests showed that the model outscored competitors like\nOpenAI\n’s o3, o3-mini, and o4-mini,\nAnthropic\n’s Claude 4 Opus, Grok 3 Beta from\nxAI\nand\nDeepSeek\nR1.\n“We’ve also addressed feedback from our previous 2.5 Pro releases, improving its style and structure — it can be more creative with better-formatted responses,” Google said in the blog post.\nWhat enterprises can expect\nGoogle’s continuous improvement of Gemini 2.5 Pro might be confusing for many, but Google previously framed these as a response to community feedback. Pricing for the new version is $1.25 per million tokens without caching for inputs and $10 for the output price.\nWhen the very first version of Gemini 2.5 Pro launched in March, VentureBeat’s Matt Marshall called it “\nthe smartest model you’re not using\n.” Since then, Google has\nintegrated the model\ninto many of its new applications and services, including “Deep Think,” where Gemini considers multiple hypotheses before responding.\nThe release of Gemini 2.5 Pro, and its two upgraded versions, revived Google’s place in the large language model space after competitors like DeepSeek and OpenAI diverted the industry’s attention to their reasoning models.\nIn just a few hours of announcing the updated Gemini 2.5 Pro, developers have already begun playing around with it. While many found the update to live up to Google’s promise of being faster, the jury is still out if this latest Gemini 2.5 Pro does actually perform better.\nFirst hour with \"Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05\"\nPositives:\n– It's faster\n– It produces more output\n– It has a better macro play (multi file edits, better overview)\n– Output structure is better (readable)\n– It's more concise and LESS APOLOGETIC!!\nBefore: \"You are absolutely…\n— Patrick Bade (@nishffx)\nJune 5, 2025\nyou guys cooked, really enjoying the app builder.\nmade a game and tested it out, it was using imagen to build assets on the fly ? and it's up, hosted, easy to share.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nSolidroad\n, an artificial intelligence startup that promises to solve one of customer service’s most persistent problems, has raised $6.5 million in seed funding to expand its platform that automatically trains customer service representatives and improves AI agents.\nThe Dublin-founded company, led by\nFirst Round Capital\nwith participation from\nY Combinator\n, addresses a fundamental challenge facing growing businesses: how to maintain high-quality customer experiences while controlling costs as conversation volumes explode past 10,000 interactions per month.\n“CX leaders scaling past 10,000 conversations a month are often stuck between two options: either they maintain quality and eat the cost, or cut costs and watch customer satisfaction suffer,” said Mark Hughes, co-founder and CEO of Solidroad, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “None of the traditional solutions work.”\nThe funding round, which brings Solidroad’s total capital raised to $8 million, comes as companies increasingly struggle to balance customer experience quality with operational efficiency. Traditional approaches — offshore outsourcing, legacy quality assurance tools, or fully automated AI agents — often result in deteriorating customer satisfaction scores, according to Hughes.\nHow AI analyzes every customer conversation to create personalized training simulations\nSolidroad’s platform operates as what Hughes calls “an aggregation layer” that sits atop existing customer communication channels, analyzing every interaction between companies and their customers. Unlike AI solutions that attempt to replace human agents entirely, Solidroad focuses on making both human representatives and AI systems more effective.\nThe platform automatically reviews 100% of customer conversations across multiple channels, applying AI-powered quality assurance that traditionally required manual review of just 1-3% of interactions. More critically, it transforms these insights into actionable improvements through individualized training simulations for human agents and refinement recommendations for AI systems.\n“Traditional QA has always been manual and retrospective,” Hughes explained. “Someone reviews a handful of calls or emails, applies a rubric, and tells you how you did. We had to completely rethink that approach. It wasn’t enough to just score conversations with AI — we set out to make the insights actionable.”\nThe system generates personalized training scenarios based on actual conversation patterns and identified skill gaps, creating what Hughes describes as targeted coaching at scale without adding process overhead or additional staff.\nCrypto.com cuts response times by 18% while major brands see dramatic ramp improvements\nEarly customer results suggest the approach delivers measurable improvements.\nCrypto.com\n, the cryptocurrency exchange, used Solidroad to reduce average handling time by 18% while simultaneously improving customer satisfaction scores from 87% to 90% — a 3-percentage-point increase that represents significant improvement in the customer service industry.\nMarketing automation platform\nActiveCampaign\nreported saving the equivalent of a full year of manual coaching time, which the company reinvested into higher-leverage training initiatives and faster feedback mechanisms. Customer engagement platform\nPodium\ncut new hire ramp time in half by embedding Solidroad’s AI simulations into their onboarding process.\n“Across the board, Solidroad customers are seeing 90% or higher go-live CSAT scores, faster ramp times, and a huge reduction in manual QA work,” Hughes said, citing additional results from\nPartnerHero\n, which saw a 30% improvement in agent proficiency scores.\nThe platform currently analyzes hundreds of thousands of conversations monthly for more than 50 customers, with new companies signing up weekly, according to the company.\nTwo former Intercom employees saw customer service tools failing even at successful companies\nHughes and co-founder Patrick Finlay, who serves as chief technology officer, developed their understanding of customer experience challenges during their tenure at Intercom, the customer messaging platform where they first met and collaborated.\n“Patrick was building features; I was selling them,” Hughes recalled. “We saw firsthand how important customer experience is to growth, but also how frustrating it was to work with tools that didn’t actually help CX teams do their jobs better. Even great companies were stuck duct-taping together solutions that weren’t built for them.”\nThe duo represents a growing trend of second-time founders applying artificial intelligence to enterprise operational challenges. Hughes previously founded and sold Gradguide, a career guidance platform, while Finlay co-founded Y Combinator-backed no-code startup\nMonaru\n.\nWhy Solidroad chose human augmentation over the AI replacement trend sweeping customer service\nThe customer experience software market has exploded as companies recognize the revenue impact of customer satisfaction, but many existing solutions focus on either full automation or basic analytics rather than systematic improvement of human performance.\nTraditional quality assurance tools typically require significant manual oversight and provide retrospective insights rather than proactive training. Meanwhile, fully automated AI agents, while promising cost savings, often struggle with complex or emotionally nuanced customer interactions, sometimes delivering what Hughes characterizes as “hallucinations” rather than helpful responses.\n“Unlike other AI-powered CX solutions, we don’t handle conversations ourselves,” Hughes explained. “Most AI CX tools are trying to replace humans with AI agents. We help them improve.”\nThis positioning reflects a broader industry debate about the optimal balance between human agents and artificial intelligence in customer service operations.\nFirst Round Capital’s bet signals confidence in human-AI collaboration over full automation\nFirst Round Capital’s lead investment represents a significant validation of Solidroad’s approach. The venture firm previously led early rounds for companies including\nNotion\n,\nUber\n, and other category-defining platforms, suggesting confidence in Solidroad’s potential to reshape customer experience technology.\n“We’re excited to be working with First Round which was the first institutional investor in companies like Notion, Uber, and many more,” Hughes noted in the company’s announcement. “But more importantly, they’ve backed founders who know how to build.”\nThe funding will primarily support aggressive hiring, particularly in San Francisco where the company is establishing its primary hub. Solidroad plans to relocate its Ireland-based team to the Bay Area while expanding across engineering and go-to-market functions.\n“We’re currently focused on hiring engineering and go-to-market roles,” Hughes said. “We’re looking for people who want to be at the frontier of AI and customer experience.”\nEnterprise security measures address growing concerns about AI analyzing sensitive conversations\nAs Solidroad analyzes sensitive customer conversations, the company has implemented enterprise-grade security measures including\nSOC 2 Type 2\nand\nISO27001\ncompliance. Customer data remains isolated in secure workspaces with no cross-client sharing, addressing privacy concerns that have become increasingly important as companies adopt AI-powered tools.\n“Security and privacy are core to how we operate,” Hughes emphasized. “Each customer’s data lives in a secure, isolated workspace. Nothing is ever shared between clients.”\nWhat Solidroad’s success reveals about the future of workplace AI adoption\nSolidroad’s approach reflects broader trends in artificial intelligence adoption, where companies increasingly seek augmentation rather than replacement of human capabilities. Rather than pursuing full automation, the platform enables what Hughes describes as “the right balance of humans and AI.”\n“We believe AI should handle repetitive, transactional work, and humans should take care of complex, emotional, and nuanced interactions,” Hughes said. “Solidroad helps companies understand where that line is and then helps both sides of it improve.”\nThis philosophy aligns with emerging enterprise AI strategies that emphasize human-AI collaboration rather than wholesale replacement of workers.\nThe bigger picture: Why continuous improvement may matter more than perfect automation\nSolidroad’s rapid growth and substantial funding round illuminate a critical shift in how enterprises approach artificial intelligence — one that prioritizes systematic improvement over revolutionary replacement. While much of the AI discourse focuses on dramatic automation that eliminates human roles entirely, Solidroad’s success suggests that companies may find greater value in technologies that make their existing workforce measurably better.\nThe timing is particularly significant. As the initial excitement around fully autonomous AI agents encounters the messy realities of customer service—where empathy, context, and nuanced problem-solving remain distinctly human strengths — companies are discovering that the most valuable AI applications may be those that enhance rather than eliminate human capabilities.\nHughes’s vision of making “every customer interaction” a learning opportunity represents something more profound than process optimization. It suggests a future where artificial intelligence serves as a continuous feedback loop, constantly raising the baseline of human performance rather than replacing it. This approach could prove more sustainable and ultimately more transformative than the binary choice between human or AI that has dominated much enterprise technology discourse.\nIn an era where customer experience increasingly determines business success, the companies that figure out how to systematically improve rather than simply automate may discover they’ve built something far more valuable than a cost-cutting tool — they’ve created a competitive advantage that compounds over time.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nMost people interested in generative AI likely already know that Large Language Models (LLMs) — like those behind ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini — are trained on massive datasets: trillions of words pulled from websites, books, codebases, and, increasingly, other media such as images, audio, and video. But why?\nFrom this data, LLMs develop a statistical, generalized understanding of language, its patterns, and the world — encoded in the form of billions of parameters, or “settings,” in a network of artificial neurons (which are mathematical functions that transform input data into output signals).\nBy being exposed to all this training data, LLMs learn to detect and generalize patterns that are reflected in the parameters of their neurons. For instance, the word “apple” often appears near terms related to food, fruit, or trees, and sometimes computers. The model picks up that apples can be red, green, or yellow, or even sometimes other colors if rotten or rare, are spelled “a-p-p-l-e” in English, and are edible. This statistical knowledge influences how the model responds when a user enters a prompt — shaping the output it generates based on the associations it “learned” from the training data.\nBut a big question — even among AI researchers — remains: how much of an LLM’s training data is used to build\ngeneralized\nrepresentations of concepts, and how much is instead\nmemorized\nverbatim or stored in a way that is identical or nearly identical to the original data?\nThis is important not only for better understanding how LLMs operate — and when they go wrong — but also as model providers defend themselves in copyright infringement lawsuits brought by data creators and owners, such as artists and record labels. If LLMs are shown to reproduce significant portions of their training data verbatim, courts could be more likely to side with plaintiffs arguing that the models unlawfully copied protected material. If not — if the models are found to generate outputs based on generalized patterns rather than exact replication — developers may be able to continue scraping and training on copyrighted data under existing legal defenses such as fair use.\nNow, we finally have an answer to the question of how much LLMs memorize versus generalize:\na new study released this week\nfrom researchers at Meta, Google DeepMind, Cornell University, and NVIDIA finds that\nGPT-style models have a fixed memorization capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter\n.\nTo understand what 3.6 bits means in practice:\nA single bit is the smallest unit of digital data, representing either a 0 or a 1. Eight bits make up one byte.\nStoring 3.6 bits allows for approximately 12.13 distinct values, as calculated by 2^3.6.\nThis is about the amount of information needed to choose one of 12 options—similar to selecting a month of the year or the outcome of a roll of a 12-sided die.\nIt\nis not enough to store even one English letter (which needs about 4.7 bits),\nbut it is just enough to encode a character from a reduced set of 10 common English letters (which requires about 3.32 bits).\nIn bytes, 3.6 bits is 0.45 bytes—less than half the size of a typical character stored in ASCII (which uses 8 bits or 1 byte).\nThis number is model-independent within reasonable architectural variations: different depths, widths, and precisions produced similar results. The estimate held steady across model sizes and even precision levels, with full-precision models reaching slightly higher values (up to 3.83 bits/parameter).\nMore training data DOES NOT lead to more memorization — in fact, a model will be\nless likely\nto memorize any single data point\nOne key takeaway from the research is that models do not memorize more when trained on more data. Instead, a model’s fixed capacity is distributed across the dataset, meaning each individual datapoint receives less attention.\nJack Morris, the lead author,\nexplained via the social network X\nthat “training on more data will force models to memorize less per-sample.”\nThese findings may help ease concerns around large models memorizing copyrighted or sensitive content.\nIf memorization is limited and diluted across many examples, the likelihood of reproducing any one specific training example decreases. In essence, more training data leads to safer generalization behavior, not increased risk.\nHow the researchers identified these findings\nTo precisely quantify how much language models memorize, the researchers used an unconventional but powerful approach:\nthey trained transformer models on datasets composed of uniformly random bitstrings\n. Each of these bitstrings was sampled independently, ensuring that no patterns, structure, or redundancy existed across examples.\nBecause each sample is unique and devoid of shared features, any ability the model shows in\nreconstructing or identifying these strings during evaluation directly reflects how much information it retained—or memorized\n—during training.\nThe key reason for this setup was to completely eliminate the possibility of generalization. Unlike natural language—which is full of grammatical structure, semantic overlap, and repeating concepts—uniform random data contains no such information. Every example is essentially noise, with no statistical relationship to any other. In such a scenario, any performance by the model on test data must come purely from memorization of the training examples, since there is no distributional pattern to generalize from.\nThe authors argue their method is perhaps\none of the only principled ways to decouple memorization from learning\nin practice, because when LLMs are trained on real language, even when they produce an output that matches the training data, it’s difficult to know whether they memorized the input or merely inferred the underlying structure from the patterns they’ve observed.\nThis method allows the researchers to map a direct relationship between the number of model parameters and the total information stored. By gradually increasing model size and training each variant to saturation, across hundreds of experiments on models ranging from 500K to 1.5 billion parameters, they observed consistent results:\n3.6 bits memorized per parameter\n, which they report as a fundamental measure of LLM memory capacity.\nThe team applied their methodology to models trained on real-world datasets as well. When trained on text, models exhibited a balance of memorization and generalization.\nSmaller datasets encouraged more memorization, but as dataset size increased, models shifted toward learning generalizable patterns. This transition was marked by a phenomenon known as “double descent,” where performance temporarily dips before improving once generalization kicks in.\nThe study also examined how model precision—comparing training in bfloat16 versus float32—affects memorization capacity. They observed a modest increase from 3.51 to 3.83 bits-per-parameter when switching to full 32-bit precision. However, this gain is far less than the doubling of available bits would suggest, implying diminishing returns from higher precision.\nUnique data is more likely to be memorized\nThe paper proposes a scaling law that relates a model’s capacity and dataset size to the effectiveness of membership inference attacks.\nThese attacks attempt to determine whether a particular data point was part of a model’s training set. The research shows that such attacks become unreliable as dataset size grows, supporting the argument that large-scale training helps reduce privacy risk.\nWhile the paper focuses on average-case behavior, some researchers have pointed out that certain types of data—such as highly unique or stylized writing—may still be more susceptible to memorization.\nThe authors acknowledge this limitation and emphasize that their method is designed to characterize general trends rather than edge cases.\nMoving toward greater human understanding of LLM understanding\nBy introducing a principled and quantifiable definition of memorization, the study gives developers and researchers new tools for evaluating the behavior of language models.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nCISOs know precisely where their AI nightmare unfolds fastest. It’s inference, the vulnerable stage where live models meet real-world data, leaving enterprises exposed to prompt injection, data leaks, and model jailbreaks.\nDatabricks Ventures\nand\nNoma Security\nare confronting these inference-stage threats head-on. Backed by a fresh $32 million Series A round led by Ballistic Ventures and Glilot Capital, with strong support from Databricks Ventures, the partnership aims to address the critical security gaps that have hindered enterprise AI deployments.\n“The number one reason enterprises hesitate to deploy AI at scale fully is security,” said Niv Braun, CEO of Noma Security, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “With Databricks, we’re embedding real-time threat analytics, advanced inference-layer protections, and proactive AI red teaming directly into enterprise workflows. Our joint approach enables organizations to accelerate their AI ambitions safely and confidently finally,” Braun said.\nSecuring AI inference demands real-time analytics and runtime defense, Gartner finds\nTraditional cybersecurity prioritizes perimeter defenses, leaving AI inference vulnerabilities dangerously overlooked. Andrew Ferguson, Vice President at Databricks Ventures, highlighted this critical security gap in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, emphasizing customer urgency regarding inference-layer security. “Our customers clearly indicated that securing AI inference in real-time is crucial, and Noma uniquely delivers that capability,” Ferguson said. “Noma directly addresses the inference security gap with continuous monitoring and precise runtime controls.”\nBraun expanded on this critical need. “We built our runtime protection specifically for increasingly complex AI interactions,” Braun explained. “Real-time threat analytics at the inference stage ensure enterprises maintain robust runtime defenses, minimizing unauthorized data exposure and adversarial model manipulation.”\nGartner’s recent analysis confirms that enterprise demand for advanced AI\nTrust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM)\ncapabilities is surging. Gartner predicts that through 2026, over\n80%\nof unauthorized AI incidents will result from internal misuse rather than external threats, reinforcing the urgency for integrated governance and real-time AI security.\nGartner’s AI TRiSM framework illustrates comprehensive security layers essential for managing enterprise AI risk effectively. Source: Gartner\nNoma’s proactive red teaming aims to ensure AI integrity from the outset\nNoma’s proactive red teaming approach is strategically central to identifying vulnerabilities long before AI models reach production, Braun told VentureBeat. By simulating sophisticated adversarial attacks during pre-production testing, Noma exposes and addresses risks early, significantly enhancing the robustness of runtime protection.\nDuring his interview with VentureBeat, Braun elaborated on the strategic value of proactive red teaming: “Red teaming is essential. We proactively uncover vulnerabilities pre-production, ensuring AI integrity from day one.”\n(Louis will be leading a roundtable about red teaming at VB Transform June 24 and 25,\nregister today\n.)\n“Reducing time to production without compromising security requires avoiding over-engineering. We design testing methodologies that directly inform runtime protections, helping enterprises move securely and efficiently from testing to deployment”, Braun advised.\nBraun elaborated further on the complexity of modern AI interactions and the depth required in proactive red teaming methods. He stressed that this process must evolve alongside increasingly sophisticated AI models, particularly those of the generative type: “Our runtime protection was specifically built to handle increasingly complex AI interactions,” Braun explained. “Each detector we employ integrates multiple security layers, including advanced NLP models and language-modeling capabilities, ensuring we provide comprehensive security at every inference step.”\nThe red team exercises not only validate the models but also strengthen enterprise confidence in deploying advanced AI systems safely at scale, directly aligning with the expectations of leading enterprise Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs).\nHow Databricks and Noma Block Critical AI Inference Threats\nSecuring AI inference from emerging threats has become a top priority for CISOs as enterprises scale their AI model pipelines. “The number one reason enterprises hesitate to deploy AI at scale fully is security,” emphasized Braun. Ferguson echoed this urgency, noting, “Our customers have clearly indicated securing AI inference in real-time is critical, and Noma uniquely delivers on that need.”\nTogether, Databricks and Noma offer integrated, real-time protection against sophisticated threats, including prompt injection, data leaks, and model jailbreaks, while aligning closely with standards such as Databricks’ DASF 2.0 and OWASP guidelines for robust governance and compliance.\nThe table below summarizes key AI inference threats and how the Databricks-Noma partnership mitigates them:\nThreat Vector\nDescription\nPotential Impact\nNoma-Databricks Mitigation\nPrompt Injection\nMalicious inputs are overriding model instructions.\nUnauthorized data exposure and harmful content generation.\nPrompt scanning with multilayered detectors (Noma); Input validation via DASF 2.0 (Databricks).\nSensitive Data Leakage\nAccidental exposure of confidential data.\nCompliance breaches, loss of intellectual property.\nReal-time sensitive data detection and masking (Noma); Unity Catalog governance and encryption (Databricks).\nModel Jailbreaking\nBypassing embedded safety mechanisms in AI models.\nGeneration of inappropriate or malicious outputs.\nRuntime jailbreak detection and enforcement (Noma); MLflow model governance (Databricks).\nAgent Tool Exploitation\nMisuse of integrated AI agent functionalities.\nUnauthorized system access and privilege escalation.\nReal-time monitoring of agent interactions (Noma); Controlled deployment environments (Databricks).\nAgent Memory Poisoning\nInjection of false data into persistent agent memory.\nCompromised decision-making, misinformation.\nAI-SPM integrity checks and memory security (Noma); Delta Lake data versioning (Databricks).\nIndirect Prompt Injection\nEmbedding malicious instructions in trusted inputs.\nAgent hijacking, unauthorized task execution.\nReal-time input scanning for malicious patterns (Noma); Secure data ingestion pipelines (Databricks).\nHow Databricks Lakehouse architecture supports AI governance and security\nDatabricks’ Lakehouse architecture combines traditional data warehouses’ structured governance capabilities with data lakes’ scalability, centralizing analytics, machine learning and AI workloads within a single, governed environment.\nBy embedding governance directly into the data lifecycle, Lakehouse architecture addresses compliance and security risks, particularly during the inference and runtime stages. It aligns closely with industry frameworks such as OWASP and MITRE ATLAS.\nDuring our interview, Braun highlighted the platform’s alignment with the stringent regulatory demands he’s seeing in sales cycles and with existing customers. “We automatically map our security controls onto widely adopted frameworks like OWASP and MITRE ATLAS. This allows our customers to comply confidently with critical regulations such as the EU AI Act and ISO 42001. Governance isn’t just about checking boxes. It’s about embedding transparency and compliance directly into operational workflows.”\nDatabricks Lakehouse integrates governance and analytics to securely manage AI workloads. Source: Gartner\nHow Databricks and Noma plan to secure enterprise AI at scale\nEnterprise AI adoption is accelerating, but as deployments expand, so do security risks, especially at the model inference stage.\nThe partnership between Databricks and Noma Security addresses this directly by providing integrated governance and real-time threat detection, with a focus on securing AI workflows from development through production.\nFerguson explained the rationale behind this combined approach clearly: “Enterprise AI requires comprehensive security at every stage, especially at runtime. Our partnership with Noma integrates proactive threat analytics directly into AI operations, giving enterprises the security coverage they need to scale their AI deployments confidently.”\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nLarge language models (LLMs) are transforming how enterprises operate, but their “black box” nature often leaves enterprises grappling with unpredictability. Addressing this critical challenge,\nAnthropic\nrecently open-sourced its\ncircuit tracing tool\n, allowing developers and researchers to directly understand and control models’ inner workings.\nThis tool allows investigators to investigate unexplained errors and unexpected behaviors in open-weight models. It can also help with granular fine-tuning of LLMs for specific internal functions.\nUnderstanding the AI’s inner logic\nThis circuit tracing tool works based on “\nmechanistic interpretability\n,” a burgeoning field dedicated to understanding how AI models function based on their internal activations rather than merely observing their inputs and outputs.\nWhile Anthropic’s\ninitial research on circuit tracing\napplied this methodology to their own\nClaude 3.5 Haiku model\n, the open-sourced tool extends this capability to open-weights models. Anthropic’s team has already used the tool to trace circuits in models like Gemma-2-2b and Llama-3.2-1b and has released a\nColab notebook\nthat helps use the library on open models.\nThe core of the tool lies in generating attribution graphs, causal maps that trace the interactions between features as the model processes information and generates an output. (Features are internal activation patterns of the model that can be roughly mapped to understandable concepts.) It is like obtaining a detailed wiring diagram of an AI’s internal thought process. More importantly, the tool enables “intervention experiments,” allowing researchers to directly modify these internal features and observe how changes in the AI’s internal states impact its external responses, making it possible to debug models.\nThe tool integrates with\nNeuronpedia\n, an open platform for understanding and experimentation with neural networks.\nCircuit tracing on Neuronpedia (source: Anthropic blog)\nPracticalities and future impact for enterprise AI\nWhile Anthropic’s circuit tracing tool is a great step toward explainable and controllable AI, it has practical challenges, including high memory costs associated with running the tool and the inherent complexity of interpreting the detailed attribution graphs.\nHowever, these challenges are typical of cutting-edge research. Mechanistic interpretability is a big area of research, and most big AI labs are developing models to investigate the inner workings of large language models. By open-sourcing the circuit tracing tool, Anthropic will enable the community to develop interpretability tools that are more scalable, automated, and accessible to a wider array of users, opening the way for practical applications of all the effort that is going into understanding LLMs.\nAs the tooling matures, the ability to understand why an LLM makes a certain decision can translate into practical benefits for enterprises.\nCircuit tracing explains how LLMs perform sophisticated multi-step reasoning. For example, in their study, the researchers were able to trace how a model inferred “Texas” from “Dallas” before arriving at “Austin” as the capital. It also revealed advanced planning mechanisms, like a model pre-selecting rhyming words in a poem to guide line composition. Enterprises can use these insights to analyze how their models tackle complex tasks like data analysis or legal reasoning. Pinpointing internal planning or reasoning steps allows for targeted optimization, improving efficiency and accuracy in complex business processes.\nSource: Anthropic\nFurthermore, circuit tracing offers better clarity into numerical operations. For example, in their study, the researchers uncovered how models handle arithmetic, like 36+59=95, not through simple algorithms but via parallel pathways and “lookup table” features for digits. For example, enterprises can use such insights to audit internal computations leading to numerical results, identify the origin of errors and implement targeted fixes to ensure data integrity and calculation accuracy within their open-source LLMs.\nFor global deployments, the tool provides insights into multilingual consistency. Anthropic’s previous research shows that models employ both language-specific and abstract, language-independent “universal mental language” circuits, with larger models demonstrating greater generalization. This can potentially help debug localization challenges when deploying models across different languages.\nFinally, the tool can help combat hallucinations and improve factual grounding. The research revealed that models have “default refusal circuits” for unknown queries, which are suppressed by “known answer” features. Hallucinations can occur when this inhibitory circuit “misfires.”\nSource: Anthropic\nBeyond debugging existing issues, this mechanistic understanding unlocks new avenues for\nfine-tuning LLMs\n. Instead of merely adjusting output behavior through trial and error, enterprises can identify and target the specific internal mechanisms driving desired or undesired traits. For instance, understanding how a model’s “Assistant persona” inadvertently incorporates hidden reward model biases, as shown in Anthropic’s research, allows developers to precisely re-tune the internal circuits responsible for alignment, leading to more robust and ethically consistent AI deployments.\nAs LLMs increasingly integrate into critical enterprise functions, their transparency, interpretability and control become increasingly critical. This new generation of tools can help bridge the gap between AI’s powerful capabilities and human understanding, building foundational trust and ensuring that enterprises can deploy AI systems that are reliable, auditable, and aligned with their strategic objectives.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nOpenAI\nannounced Wednesday that its business user base has surged 50% since February, reaching 3 million paying enterprise customers as the artificial intelligence company unveiled an expansive suite of new workplace tools designed to compete directly with\nMicrosoft’s enterprise AI offerings\n.\nThe milestone, revealed alongside the launch of several new business-focused features, underscores OpenAI’s aggressive push into corporate markets where reliable, secure AI tools can command premium prices. The company introduced new “\nconnectors\n” that integrate ChatGPT with popular business applications, a meeting transcription feature called Record Mode, and enhanced versions of its\nDeep Research\nand\nCodex\ncoding tools.\n“ChatGPT is helping transform businesses by helping employees work with more productivity, efficiency, and more strategically,” an OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat. “Over the last few months, we’ve continued evolving ChatGPT into an increasingly impactful platform for work with business products like connectors, record mode with ChatGPT, Codex, image generation, deep research, and more.”\nThe rapid enterprise adoption comes as OpenAI faces intensifying competition from tech giants like\nMicrosoft\nand\nGoogle\n, which offer deep workplace integrations through existing enterprise relationships. Yet the company appears to be winning customers by positioning itself as the premier destination for cutting-edge AI capabilities.\n“Customers often choose ChatGPT for direct access to SOTA (state-of-the-art) models and tools, combined with enterprise-grade security and commitments on never training on business data,” the spokesperson said, emphasizing OpenAI’s competitive advantage as an “AI-native” company focused solely on advancing artificial intelligence rather than integrating it into legacy systems.\nOpenAI’s new workplace connectors challenge Microsoft and Google’s enterprise AI dominance\nThe newly announced connectors represent OpenAI’s most direct challenge yet to\nMicrosoft’s workplace AI strategy\n. The integrations allow workers to access company data stored in\nDropbox\n,\nBox\n,\nSharePoint\n,\nOneDrive\n, and\nGoogle Drive\ndirectly through ChatGPT, eliminating the need to switch between applications.\nThe connectors also extend to OpenAI’s\nDeep Research\nfeature, an AI agent that conducts multi-step research tasks by gathering and synthesizing information from both external sources and internal company data. Deep Research connectors now work with\nHubSpot\n,\nLinear\n, and various Microsoft and Google tools, enabling the creation of comprehensive research reports that combine web data with proprietary business insights.\n“Every organization holds vast knowledge, but it’s often trapped in silos,” OpenAI explained in its announcement. The company’s goal is to “evolve ChatGPT into a platform that unlocks your organization’s entire knowledge base — enabling each employee to continuously leverage this knowledge.”\nRecord Mode, available to Team users, automatically transcribes and summarizes meetings while generating actionable items and integrating with internal documents. The feature represents OpenAI’s entry into a market dominated by services like\nOtter.ai\nand Microsoft’s own transcription tools.\nPerhaps most significantly, OpenAI expanded access to its\nCodex\nsoftware engineering agent, powered by the new codex-1 model based on the company’s upcoming o3 reasoning system. Codex can write code, fix bugs, and propose pull requests while working in isolated cloud environments, offering enterprises a powerful tool for accelerating software development.\nData security and privacy remain key hurdles for enterprise ChatGPT adoption\nDespite the growth, OpenAI continues to face questions about data security and privacy — critical concerns for enterprise customers handling sensitive business information. When asked about companies’ hesitations to input confidential data into ChatGPT, particularly given recent AI security incidents across the industry, the OpenAI spokesperson directed attention to the company’s security policies without providing specific details.\n“Security is critical at OpenAI–more details here,” the spokesperson said, referring to the company’s published security documentation.\nThe response highlights ongoing challenges for AI companies seeking enterprise adoption. Many organizations remain cautious about cloud-based AI services, particularly after high-profile data breaches and concerns about how AI models are trained and where sensitive information might be stored.\nOpenAI has attempted to address these concerns by implementing enterprise-grade security measures and promising never to train its models on business customer data. However, the company’s rapid growth and the complex technical nature of large language models continue to generate skepticism among some IT decision-makers.\nSam Altman says AI is ready for enterprise deployment as competition heats up\nOpenAI’s enterprise push occurs amid a broader transformation in how businesses adopt artificial intelligence. Recent industry analysis suggests that AI adoption is accelerating faster than any previous technology in history, with companies moving beyond experimental pilots to production deployments.\n“Certainly, what you are seeing with enterprises and AI is that the people making the early bets and learning very quickly are doing much better than the people who are waiting to see how it’s all going to shake out,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said recently at the Snowflake Summit in San Francisco, advising enterprise leaders to “just do it” when it comes to AI adoption.\nThis represents a notable shift in Altman’s messaging. A year ago, he advised companies to experiment cautiously with AI rather than deploy it in critical business processes. Now, he argues that AI capabilities have matured sufficiently for production use in most enterprise contexts.\nThe competitive landscape has also intensified significantly. While OpenAI dominates public attention and developer mindshare, the company faces mounting pressure from well-funded rivals.\nAnthropic\n, the AI safety-focused startup founded by former OpenAI researchers, has been\nsuccessfully recruiting top talent\nfrom both OpenAI and Google’s DeepMind division, according to recent talent analysis.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft’s integration of OpenAI technologies into its\nOffice suite\nand the recent launch of\nfree Sora video generation\nthrough Bing demonstrate how the partnership between the two companies continues to evolve. Microsoft’s announcement that Bing users can now access OpenAI’s Sora video creation tool for free — bypassing the $20 monthly ChatGPT subscription requirement — illustrates the complex dynamics of their relationship.\nDeep research and coding capabilities give OpenAI a competitive edge in enterprise markets\nOpenAI’s enterprise success stems largely from its technical capabilities, particularly in reasoning and research tasks. The company’s\nDeep Research\nfeature, powered by a version of the upcoming\no3 model\n, represents a significant advancement in AI agents’ ability to conduct autonomous research and analysis.\nIn benchmark testing, the system powering Deep Research achieved new state-of-the-art results on challenging evaluations. On “\nHumanity’s Last Exam\n,” a comprehensive test covering expert-level questions across more than 100 subjects, the model scored 26.6% accuracy — nearly three times higher than previous leading systems and significantly outperforming human experts in many domains.\nThe\nCodex\nprogramming agent similarly demonstrates advanced capabilities, achieving 67% accuracy on software engineering benchmarks and showing the ability to work autonomously on complex coding tasks. Internal evaluations suggest that Codex can automate multiple hours of difficult manual programming work, potentially transforming how software development teams operate.\nThese technical achievements provide OpenAI with a crucial competitive moat in enterprise markets, where customers are willing to pay premium prices for demonstrably superior capabilities.\nTalent wars and governance challenges threaten OpenAI’s enterprise momentum\nOpenAI’s enterprise momentum reflects a broader shift in the AI industry toward practical business applications rather than consumer novelties. The company’s growth from 2 million to 3 million business users in just four months suggests that enterprises are moving past initial skepticism about AI capabilities and beginning large-scale deployments.\nHowever, significant challenges remain. The company continues to lose key technical talent to competitors like Anthropic, which has emerged as a formidable rival by emphasizing AI safety and offering researchers greater autonomy. Recent analysis shows that OpenAI engineers are\neight times more likely to leave for Anthropic than vice versa\n, raising questions about the company’s ability to retain top talent as competition intensifies.\nOpenAI also faces structural questions about its governance and funding model. The company’s complex nonprofit-controlled structure has created tensions with investors, particularly after the dramatic five-day period in late 2023 when CEO Sam Altman was fired and then reinstated. The incident, which is reportedly being adapted into a feature film titled “\nArtificial\n,” highlighted the unstable nature of OpenAI’s governance arrangements.\nDespite these challenges, OpenAI’s enterprise trajectory appears strong. The company’s focus on providing direct access to state-of-the-art AI capabilities, combined with enterprise-grade security and novel workplace integrations, has created a compelling value proposition for business customers.\nAs AI capabilities continue to advance rapidly, OpenAI’s success in capturing enterprise market share will likely depend on its ability to maintain technical leadership while addressing fundamental questions about governance, talent retention, and long-term strategic direction. The company’s next phase of growth will test whether its current advantages can withstand intensifying competition from both established tech giants and ambitious startups.\nThe 3 million business user milestone represents more than just a growth metric — it signals the beginning of AI’s mainstream adoption in corporate America, with OpenAI positioned as the early leader in what promises to be one of the technology industry’s most significant transformations.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nMistral AI\nunveiled a comprehensive enterprise coding assistant Wednesday, marking the French artificial intelligence company’s most aggressive push yet into the corporate software development market dominated by Microsoft’s\nGitHub Copilot\nand other Silicon Valley rivals.\nThe new product, called\nMistral Code\n, bundles the company’s latest AI models with integrated development environment plugins and on-premise deployment options specifically designed for large enterprises with strict security requirements. The launch directly challenges existing coding assistants by offering what the company says is unprecedented customization and data sovereignty.\n“Our most significant features are that we propose more customization and to serve our models on premise,” said Baptiste Rozière, a research scientist at Mistral AI and former Meta researcher who helped develop the original Llama language model, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “For customization, we can specialize our models for the customer’s codebase, which can make a huge difference in practice to get the right completions for workflows that are specific to the customer.”\nThe enterprise focus reflects Mistral’s broader strategy to differentiate itself from\nOpenAI\nand other American competitors by emphasizing data privacy and European regulatory compliance. Unlike typical software-as-a-service coding tools,\nMistral Code\nallows companies to deploy the entire AI stack within their own infrastructure, ensuring that proprietary code never leaves corporate servers.\n“With on-prem, we can serve the model on the customer’s hardware,” Rozière explained. “They get the service without any of their code ever leaving their own servers, ensuring that it respects their safety and confidentiality standards.”\nHow Mistral identified four key barriers blocking enterprise AI adoption\nThe product launch comes as enterprise adoption of AI coding assistants has stalled at the proof-of-concept stage for many organizations. Mistral surveyed vice presidents of engineering, platform leads, and chief information security officers to identify four recurring barriers: limited connectivity to proprietary repositories, minimal model customization, shallow task coverage for complex workflows, and fragmented service-level agreements across multiple vendors.\nMistral Code\naddresses these concerns through what the company calls a “vertically-integrated offering” that includes models, plugins, administrative controls, and 24/7 support under a single contract. The platform is built on the proven open-source Continue project but adds enterprise-grade features like fine-grained role-based access control, audit logging, and usage analytics.\nAt the technical core, Mistral Code leverages four specialized AI models:\nCodestral\nfor code completion,\nCodestral Embed\nfor code search and retrieval,\nDevstral\nfor multi-task coding workflows, and\nMistral Medium\nfor conversational assistance. The system supports more than 80 programming languages and can analyze files, Git differences, terminal output, and issue tracking systems.\nCrucially for enterprise customers, the platform allows fine-tuning of underlying models on private code repositories — a capability that distinguishes it from proprietary alternatives tied to external APIs. This customization can dramatically improve code completion accuracy for company-specific frameworks and coding patterns.\nWhy top Meta researchers are joining Mistral’s coding AI push\nMistral’s technical capabilities stem partly from a\nmajor talent acquisition strategy\nthat has poached key researchers from Meta’s Llama AI team. Of the 14 authors credited on Meta’s landmark\n2023 Llama paper\nthat established the company’s open-source AI strategy, only three remain at the social media giant. Five of those departed researchers, including Rozière, have joined Mistral over the past 18 months.\nThe talent exodus from Meta reflects broader competitive dynamics in the AI industry, where top researchers command premium compensation and the opportunity to shape the next generation of AI systems. For Mistral, these hires provide deep expertise in large language model development and training techniques originally pioneered at Meta.\nMarie-Anne Lachaux and Thibaut Lavril, both former Meta researchers and co-authors of the original\nLlama paper\n, now work as founding members and AI research engineers at Mistral. Their expertise contributes directly to the development of Mistral’s coding-focused models, particularly\nDevstral\n, which the company released as an open-source software engineering agent in May.\nDevstral model outperforms OpenAI while running on a laptop\nDevstral\nshowcases Mistral’s commitment to open-source development, offering a 24-billion-parameter model under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. The model achieves a 46.8% score on the\nSWE-Bench Verified benchmark\n, surpassing OpenAI’s GPT-4.1-mini by more than 20 percentage points while remaining small enough to run on a single\nNvidia RTX 4090\ngraphics card or a MacBook with 32 gigabytes of memory.\n“Right now, it’s by pretty far the best open model for SWE-bench verified and for code agents,” Rozière told VentureBeat. “And it’s also a very small model — only 24 billion parameters — that you can run locally, even on a MacBook.”\nThe dual approach of open-source models alongside proprietary enterprise services reflects Mistral’s broader market positioning. While the company maintains its commitment to open AI development, it generates revenue through premium features, customization services, and enterprise support contracts.\nBanks and railways deploy Mistral’s on-premise coding tools\nEarly enterprise customers validate Mistral’s approach across regulated industries where data sovereignty concerns prevent adoption of cloud-based coding assistants.\nAbanca\n, a leading Spanish and Portuguese bank, has deployed Mistral Code at scale using a hybrid configuration that allows cloud-based prototyping while keeping core banking code on-premises.\nSNCF\n, France’s national railway company, uses Mistral Code Serverless to empower its 4,000 developers with AI assistance.\nCapgemini\n, the global systems integrator, has deployed the platform on-premises for more than 1,500 developers working on client projects in regulated industries.\nThese deployments demonstrate enterprise appetite for AI coding tools that provide advanced capabilities without compromising data security or regulatory compliance. Unlike consumer-focused coding assistants, Mistral Code’s enterprise architecture supports the administrative oversight and audit trails required by large organizations.\nEuropean AI regulations give Mistral an edge over Silicon Valley rivals\nThe enterprise coding assistant market has attracted major investment and competition from technology giants. Microsoft’s\nGitHub Copilot\ndominates with millions of individual users, while newer entrants like\nAnthropic’s Claude\nand\nGoogle’s Gemini-powered tools\ncompete for enterprise market share.\nMistral’s European heritage provides regulatory advantages under the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\nand the\nEU AI Act\n, which impose strict requirements on AI systems processing personal data. The company’s €1 billion in funding, including a recent €600 million round led by\nGeneral Catalyst\nat a $6 billion valuation, provides resources to compete with well-funded American rivals.\nHowever, Mistral faces challenges in scaling globally while maintaining its open-source commitments. The company’s recent shift toward proprietary models like\nMistral Medium 3\nhas drawn criticism from open-source advocates who view it as abandoning founding principles in favor of commercial viability.\nBeyond code completion: AI agents that write entire software modules\nMistral Code goes far beyond basic code completion to encompass entire project workflows. The platform can open files, write new modules, update tests, and execute shell commands—all under configurable approval processes that maintain senior engineer oversight.\nThe system’s retrieval-augmented generation capabilities allow it to understand project context by analyzing codebases, documentation, and issue tracking systems. This contextual awareness enables more accurate code suggestions and reduces the hallucination problems that plague simpler AI coding tools.\nMistral continues developing larger, more capable coding models while maintaining efficiency for local deployment. The company’s partnership with\nAll Hands AI\n, creators of the OpenDevin agent framework, extends Mistral’s models into autonomous software engineering workflows that can complete entire feature implementations.\nWhat Mistral’s enterprise focus means for the future of AI coding\nThe launch of Mistral Code reflects the maturation of AI coding assistants from experimental tools to enterprise-critical infrastructure. As organizations increasingly view AI as essential for developer productivity, vendors must balance advanced capabilities with the security, compliance, and customization requirements of large enterprises.\nMistral’s success in attracting top talent from Meta and other leading AI labs demonstrates the ongoing consolidation of expertise within a small number of well-funded companies. This concentration of talent accelerates innovation while potentially limiting the diversity of approaches to AI development.\nFor enterprises evaluating AI coding tools, Mistral Code offers a European alternative to American platforms, with specific advantages for organizations prioritizing data sovereignty and regulatory compliance. The platform’s success will likely depend on its ability to deliver measurable productivity improvements while maintaining the security and customization features that distinguish it from commodity alternatives.\nThe broader implications extend beyond coding assistants to the fundamental question of how AI systems should be deployed in enterprise environments. Mistral’s emphasis on on-premise deployment and model customization contrasts with the cloud-centric approaches favored by many Silicon Valley competitors.\nAs the AI coding assistant market matures, success will likely depend not just on model capabilities but on vendors’ ability to address the complex operational, security, and compliance requirements that govern enterprise software adoption. Mistral Code tests whether European AI companies can compete with American rivals by offering differentiated approaches to enterprise deployment and data governance.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

In the latest round of MLPerf Training — the 12th since the benchmark’s introduction in 2018 — the Nvidia AI platform delivered the highest performance at scale on every benchmark and powered every result submitted on the benchmark’s toughest large language model (LLM)-focused test: Llama 3.1 405B pretraining.\nNvidia touted its performance on MLPerf training benchmarks.\nThe Nvidia platform was the only one that submitted results on every MLPerf Training v5.0 benchmark — underscoring its exceptional performance and versatility across a wide array of AI workloads, spanning LLMs, recommendation systems, multimodal LLMs, object detection and graph neural networks.\nThe at-scale submissions used two AI supercomputers powered by the Nvidia Blackwell platform: Tyche, built using Nvidia GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems, and Nyx, based on Nvidia DGX B200 systems. In addition, Nvidia collaborated with CoreWeave and IBM to submit GB200 NVL72 results using a total of 2,496 Blackwell GPUs and 1,248 Nvidia Grace CPUs.\nOn the new Llama 3.1 405B pretraining benchmark, Blackwell delivered 2.2 times greater performance compared with previous-generation architecture at the same scale.\nNvidia Blackwell is driving AI factories.\nOn the Llama 2 70B LoRA fine-tuning benchmark, Nvidia DGX B200 systems, powered by eight Blackwell GPUs, delivered 2.5 times more performance compared with a submission using the same number of GPUs in the prior round.\nThese performance leaps highlight advancements in the Blackwell architecture, including high-density liquid-cooled racks, 13.4TB of coherent memory per rack, fifth-generation Nvidia NVLink and Nvidia NVLink Switch interconnect technologies for scale-up and Nvidia Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking for scale-out. Plus, innovations in the Nvidia NeMo Framework software stack raise the bar for next-generation multimodal LLM training, critical for bringing agentic AI applications to market.\nThese agentic AI-powered applications will one day run in AI factories — the engines of the agentic AI economy. These new applications will produce tokens and valuable intelligence that can be applied to almost every industry and academic domain.\nThe Nvidia data center platform includes GPUs, CPUs, high-speed fabrics and networking, as well as a vast array of software like Nvidia CUDA-X libraries, the NeMo Framework, Nvidia TensorRT-LLM and Nvidia Dynamo. This highly tuned ensemble of hardware and software technologies empowers organizations to train and deploy models more quickly, dramatically accelerating time to value.\nBlackwell is handily beating its predecessor Hopper in AI training.\nThe Nvidia partner ecosystem participated extensively in this MLPerf round. Beyond the submission with CoreWeave and IBM, other compelling submissions were from ASUS, Cisco, Giga Computing, Lambda, Lenovo Quanta Cloud Technology and Supermicro.\nFirst MLPerf Training submissions using GB200 were developed by MLCommons Association with more than 125 members and affiliates. Its time-to-train metric ensures training process produces a model that meets required accuracy. And its standardized benchmark run rules ensure apples-to-apples performance comparisons. The results are peer-reviewed before publication.\nThe basics on training benchmarks\nNvidia’s is getting great scaling on its latest AI processors.\nDave Salvator is someone I knew when he was part of the tech press. Now he is director of accelerated computing products in the Accelerated Computing Group at Nvidia. In a press briefing, Salvator noted that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks about this notion of the types of scaling laws for AI. They include pre training, where you’re basically teaching the AI model knowledge. That’s starting from zero. It’s a heavy computational lift that is the backbone of AI, Salvator said.\nFrom there, Nvidia moves into post-training scaling. This is where models kind of go to school, and this is a place where you can do things like fine tuning, for instance, where you bring in a different data set to teach a pre-trained model that’s been trained up to a point, to give it additional domain knowledge of your particular data set.\nNvidia has moved on from just chips to building AI infrastructure.\nAnd then lastly, there is time-test scaling or reasoning, or sometimes called long thinking. The other term this goes by is agentic AI. It’s AI that can actually think and reason and problem solve, where you basically ask a question and get a relatively simple answer. Test time scaling and reasoning can actually work on much more complicated tasks and deliver rich analysis.\nAnd then there is also generative AI which can generate content on an as needed basis that can include text summarization translations, but then also visual content and even audio content. There are a lot of types of scaling that go on in the AI world. For the benchmarks, Nvidia focused on pre-training and post-training results.\n“That’s where AI begins what we call the investment phase of AI. And then when you get into inferencing and deploying those models and then generating basically those tokens, that’s where you begin to get your return on your investment in AI,” he said.\nThe MLPerf benchmark is in its 12th round and it dates back to 2018. The consortium backing it has over 125 members and it’s been used for both inference and training tests. The industry sees the benchmarks as robust.\n“As I’m sure a lot of you are aware, sometimes performance claims in the world of AI can be a bit of the Wild West. MLPerf seeks to bring some order to that chaos,” Salvator said. “Everyone has to do the same amount of work. Everyone is held to the same standard in terms of convergence. And once results are submitted, those results are then reviewed and vetted by all the other submitters, and people can ask questions and even challenge results.”\nThe most intuitive metric around training is how long does it take to train an AI model trained to what’s called convergence. That means hitting a specified level of accuracy right. It’s an apples-to-apples comparison, Salvator said, and it takes into account constantly changing workloads.\nThis year, there’s a new Llama 3.140 5b workload, which replaces the ChatGPT 170 5b workload that was in the benchmark previously. In the benchmarks, Salvator noted Nvidia had a number of records. The Nvidia GB200 NVL72 AI factories are fresh from the fabrication factories. From one generation of chips (Hopper) to the next (Blackwell), Nvidia saw a 2.5 times improvement for image generation results.\n“We’re still fairly early in the Blackwell product life cycle, so we fully expect to be getting more performance over time from the Blackwell architecture, as we continue to refine our software optimizations and as new, frankly heavier workloads come into the market,” Salvator said.\nHe noted Nvidia was the only company to have submitted entries for all benchmarks.\n“The great performance we’re achieving comes through a combination of things. It’s our fifth-gen NVLink and NVSwitch up delivering up to 2.66 times more performance, along with other just general architectural goodness in Blackwell, along with just our ongoing software optimizations that make that make that performance possible,” Salvator said.\nHe added, “Because of Nvidia’s heritage, we have been known for the longest time as those GPU guys. We certainly make great GPUs, but we have gone from being just a chip company to not only being a system company with things like our DGX servers, to now building entire racks and data centers with things like our rack designs, which are now reference designs to help our partners get to market faster, to building entire data centers, which ultimately then build out entire infrastructure, which we then are now referring to as AI factories. It’s really been this really interesting journey.”\nJoin the GamesBeat community!\nEnjoy access to special events, private newsletters and more.\nJoin here\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.

A revamped version of the RewardBench benchmark looks to give organizations a better idea of a model’s real-life performance.\nThe\nAllen Institute for AI (Ai2)\nlaunched RewardBench 2, an updated version of its reward model benchmark, RewardBench, which they claim provides a more holistic view of model performance and assesses how models align with an enterprise’s goals and standards.\nAi2 built RewardBench with classification tasks that measure correlations through inference-time compute and downstream training. RewardBench mainly deals with reward models (RM), which can act as judges and evaluate LLM outputs. RMs assign a score or a “reward” that guides reinforcement learning with human feedback (RHLF).\nRewardBench 2 is here! We took a long time to learn from our first reward model evaluation tool to make one that is substantially harder and more correlated with both downstream RLHF and inference-time scaling.\npic.twitter.com/NGetvNrOQV\n— Ai2 (@allen_ai)\nJune 2, 2025\nNathan Lambert, a senior research scientist at Ai2, told VentureBeat that the first RewardBench worked as intended when it was launched. Still, the model environment rapidly evolved, and so should its benchmarks.\n“As reward models became more advanced and use cases more nuanced, we quickly recognized with the community that the first version didn’t fully capture the complexity of real-world human preferences,” he said.\nLambert added that with RewardBench 2, “we set out to improve both the breadth and depth of evaluation—incorporating more diverse, challenging prompts and refining the methodology to reflect better how humans actually judge AI outputs in practice.” He said the second version uses unseen human prompts, has a more challenging scoring setup and new domains.\nUsing evaluations for models that evaluate\nWhile reward models test how well models work, it’s also important that RMs align with company values; otherwise, the fine-tuning and reinforcement learning process can reinforce bad behavior, such as hallucinations, reduce generalization, and score harmful responses too high.\nRewardBench 2 covers six different domains: factuality, precise instruction following, math, safety, focus and ties.\n“Enterprises should use RewardBench 2 in two different ways depending on their application. If they’re performing RLHF themselves, they should adopt the best practices and datasets from leading models in their own pipelines because reward models need on-policy training recipes (i.e. reward models that mirror the model they’re trying to train with RL). For inference time scaling or data filtering, RewardBench 2 has shown that they can select the best model for their domain and see correlated performance,” Lambert said.\nLambert noted that benchmarks like RewardBench offer users a way to evaluate the models they’re choosing based on the “dimensions that matter most to them, rather than relying on a narrow one-size-fits-all score.” He said the idea of performance, which many evaluation methods claim to assess, is very subjective because a good response from a model highly depends on the context and goals of the user. At the same time, human preferences get very nuanced.\nAi2 released the first version of\nRewardBench in March 2024\n. At the time, the company said it was the first benchmark and leaderboard for reward models. Since then, several methods for benchmarking and improving RM have emerged. Researchers at\nMeta\n’s FAIR came out with\nreWordBench\n.\nDeepSeek\nreleased a\nnew technique called Self-Principled Critique Tuning\nfor smarter and scalable RM.\nSuper excited that our second reward model evaluation is out. It's substantially harder, much cleaner, and well correlated with downstream PPO/BoN sampling.\nHappy hillclimbing!\nHuge congrats to\n@saumyamalik44\nwho lead the project with a total commitment to excellence.\nhttps://t.co/c0b6rHTXY5\n— Nathan Lambert (@natolambert)\nJune 2, 2025\nHow models performed\nSince RewardBench 2 is an updated version of RewardBench, Ai2 tested both existing and newly trained models to see if they continue to rank high. These included a variety of models, such as versions of Gemini, Claude, GPT-4.1, and Llama-3.1, along with datasets and models like Qwen, Skywork, and\nits own Tulu\n.\nThe company found that larger reward models perform best on the benchmark because their base models are stronger. Overall, the strongest-performing models are variants of Llama-3.1 Instruct. In terms of focus and safety, Skywork data “is particularly helpful,” and Tulu did well on factuality.\nAi2 said that while they believe RewardBench 2 “is a step forward in broad, multi-domain accuracy-based evaluation” for reward models, they cautioned that model evaluation should be mainly used as a guide to pick models that work best with an enterprise’s needs.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

We lost Iwata San before the launch, but his clarity, his purpose — it still inspires our work,” Huang said. “Every day together, we poured everything into that system. The Nintendo Switch took over 500 engineer years at Nvidia. We rethought the entire stack, chip architecture, OS, APIs, game engines, so the magic could travel with you.”\nHuang said the results speak for themselves. Over 150 million consoles sold. It was a global platform that brought families together, empowered indie creators and redefined what a console could be.\n“And now a bold new chapter begins the mission build a new console that takes the original vision further to make it so we had to reinvent everything,” Huang said of the Switch 2. “The chip inside Nintendo Switch 2 is unlike anything we’ve built before.”\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 has a custom Nvidia processor, the T239, with an Ampere-based GPU. It features 1,536 CUDA cores, runs at 1GHz (docked), and 561MHz (mobile), with a memory interface of 128-bit LPDDR5. The GPU can deliver 3.07 TeraFLOPS in docked mode and 1.71 TeraFLOPS in portable use.\nThe system’s CPU has eight ARM Cortex-A78C cores, 12GB LPDDR5X (128-bit interface), memory bandwidth of 102 GB/s (docked), 68 GB/s (mobile) and storage of 256 GB UFS 3.1. It has RT Cores, Tensor Cores for AI-driven enhancements, DLSS support and 4K gaming in TV mode.\nHe said it brings together multiple breakthroughs: the most advanced graphics ever in a mobile device, full hardware ray tracing, high dynamic range for brighter highlights and deeper shadows, and an architecture that supports backward compatibility, dedicated AI processors to sharpen animations and enhance gameplay in real time, and ultra-low power.\n“We optimize the semiconductor process technology for high performance in a handheld device so we can go wherever you go,” he said. “This chip is a technical marvel. It delivers performance, intelligence and beauty in the palm of your Switch 2 is more than a new console. It’s a new chapter worthy of Iwata-san’s vision.”\nHe added, “To our friends at Nintendo, congratulations, we’re honored to be on this journey with you. And to everyone who loves games, let the fun begin. This is a proud moment for all of us at Nvidia too.”\nGames\nBeat\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on LinkedIn\nFollow us on RSS\nPress Releases\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nShare a News Tip\nContribute to DataDecisionMakers\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n© 2025\nVentureBeat\n.
