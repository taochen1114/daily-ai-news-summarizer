Headlines quickly framed this as the beginning of the end for human engineers — AI was coming for their jobs.\nBut those headlines miss the mark entirely. What’s really happening is a transformation of engineering itself.\nGartner named agentic AI\nas its top tech trend for this year.\nThe firm also predicts\nthat 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI by 2028 — a significant portion, but far from universal adoption. The extended timeline suggests a gradual evolution rather than a wholesale replacement. The real risk isn’t AI taking jobs; it’s engineers who fail to adapt and are left behind as the nature of engineering work evolves.\nThe reality across the tech industry reveals an explosion of demand for engineers with\nAI expertise\n. Professional services firms are aggressively recruiting engineers with generative AI experience, and technology companies are creating entirely new engineering positions focused on AI implementation. The market for professionals who can effectively leverage AI tools is extraordinarily competitive.\nWhile claims of AI-driven productivity gains may be grounded in real progress, such announcements often reflect investor pressure for profitability as much as technological advancement. Many companies are adept at shaping narratives to position themselves as leaders in\nenterprise AI\n— a strategy that aligns well with broader market expectations.\nHow AI is transforming engineering work\nThe relationship between AI and engineering is evolving in four key ways, each representing a distinct capability that augments human engineering talent but certainly doesn’t replace it.\nAI excels at summarization, helping engineers distill massive codebases, documentation and technical specifications into actionable insights. Rather than spending hours poring over documentation, engineers can get AI-generated summaries and focus on implementation.\nAlso,\nAI’s inferencing capabilities\nallow it to analyze patterns in code and systems and proactively suggest optimizations. This empowers engineers to identify potential bugs and make informed decisions more quickly and with greater confidence.\nThird, AI has proven remarkably adept at converting code between languages. This capability is proving invaluable as organizations modernize their tech stacks and attempt to preserve institutional knowledge embedded in legacy systems.\nFinally, the true power of gen AI lies in its expansion capabilities — creating novel content like code, documentation or even system architectures. Engineers are using AI to explore more possibilities than they could alone, and we’re seeing these capabilities transform engineering across industries.\nIn healthcare, AI helps create personalized medical instruction systems that adjust based on a patient’s specific conditions and medical history. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, AI-enhanced systems optimize production schedules to reduce waste and ensure an adequate supply of critical medications. Major banks have invested in gen AI for longer than most people realize, too; they are building systems that help manage complex compliance requirements while improving customer service.\nThe new engineering skills landscape\nAs AI reshapes engineering work, it’s creating entirely new in-demand specializations and skill sets, like the ability to effectively\ncommunicate with AI systems\n. Engineers who excel at working with AI can extract significantly better results.\nSimilar to how DevOps emerged as a discipline, large language model operations (LLMOps) focuses on deploying, monitoring and optimizing LLMs in production environments. Practitioners of LLMOps track model drift, evaluate alternative models and help to ensure consistent quality of AI-generated outputs.\nCreating standardized environments where AI tools can be safely and effectively deployed is becoming crucial. Platform engineering provides templates and guardrails that enable engineers to build AI-enhanced applications more efficiently. This standardization helps ensure consistency, security and maintainability across an organization’s AI implementations.\nHuman-AI collaboration ranges from AI merely providing recommendations that humans may ignore, to fully autonomous systems that operate independently. The most effective engineers understand when and how to apply the appropriate level of AI autonomy based on the context and consequences of the task at hand.\nKeys to successful AI integration\nEffective AI governance frameworks — which ranks No. 2 on Gartner’s top trends list — establish clear guidelines while leaving room for innovation. These frameworks address ethical considerations, regulatory compliance and risk management without stifling the creativity that makes AI valuable.\nRather than treating security as an afterthought, successful organizations build it into their AI systems from the beginning. This includes robust testing for vulnerabilities like hallucinations, prompt injection and data leakage. By incorporating security considerations into the development process, organizations can move quickly without compromising safety.\nEngineers who can design agentic AI systems create significant value. We’re seeing systems where one AI model handles natural language understanding, another performs reasoning and a third generates appropriate responses, all working in concert to deliver better results than any single model could provide.\nAs we look ahead, the relationship between engineers and AI systems will likely evolve from tool and user to something more symbiotic. Today’s AI systems are powerful but limited; they lack true understanding and rely heavily on human guidance. Tomorrow’s systems may become true collaborators, proposing novel solutions beyond what engineers might have considered and identifying potential risks humans might overlook.\nYet the engineer’s essential role — understanding requirements, making ethical judgments and translating human needs into technological solutions — will remain irreplaceable. In this partnership between human creativity and AI, there lies the potential to solve problems we’ve never been able to tackle before — and that’s anything but a replacement.\nRizwan Patel is head of information security and emerging technology at\nAltimetrik\n.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The electronics store chain was an embodiment of the valley’s tech roots.\nBut\nMicro Center\n, an electronics retailer from Ohio, has opened its 29th store in Santa Clara, California. And so the nerd kingdom has returned. I see this as a big deal, following up on the opening of the Nintendo store — the second in the country after New York — in San Francisco earlier this month. After years of bad economic news, it’s nice to see signs that the Bay Area is coming back.\nNo. To answer your question, nerds cannot live at the Micro Center store.\nBut this isn’t just any store. It’s a symbol — a sign that shows tech still has a physical presence in Silicon Valley, in addition to places like the Buck’s Restaurant, the\nDenny’s\nwhere Nvidia started, the Intel Museum, the\nComputer History Museum\n, the California Academy of Sciences and the\nTech Museum of Innovation\n. Other historic hangouts for techies like\nWalker’s Wagon Wheel\n, Atari’s headquarters, Lion & Compass — even Circuit City — have long since closed. But hey, we’ve got the Micro Center store, and the\nApple spaceship\nis not that far away.\nThe grand opening week has been going well and I got a tour of the superstore from Dan Ackerman, a veteran tech journalist who is editor-in-chief at Micro Center News. As I walked into the place, Ackerman was finishing a chat with iFixit, a tech repair publication which has its own space for podcasts inside the store. That was unexpected, as I’ve never seen a store embrace social media in such a way.\nCan you stump the geniuses at the Knowledge Bar at Micro Center?\nNearby was the Knowledge Bar, where you can get all your tech questions answered — much like the Genius Bars in Apple Stores. And there were repair tables out in the open.\nThere are a lot of things for tech enthusiasts can like about Micro Center. First, it’s not as sprawling as Fry’s, which had zany themes like ancient Egypt and a weird mix of electronics goods as well as household appliances, cosmetics, magazines and tons of snack foods. (The Egyptian-themed Campbell, California Fry’s store that I drove by often was 156,000 square feet, and now it’s home to a pickleball court complex). Fry’s was a store that stereotyped nerds and Silicon Valley, which also had its own HBO television show that carried on the stereotypes.\nNvidia’s latest RTX 50 Series GPUs were in stock at Micro Center.\nThe Micro Center store, by contrast, is smaller at 40,000 square feet and stocked with many more practical nerd items. For the grand opening, this store had the very practical product of more than 4,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) in stock from Nvidia (which just launched its\n50 Series GPUs\n) and\nAMD\n, Ackerman told me. Some of those graphics cards cost as much as $4,000.\nNot to be outdone. AMD has a row of GPUs at Micro Center too.\n“There were people waiting to get to the GPUs,” Ackerman said.\nOn display was a gold-plated graphics card that was being auctioned off for charity. It was signed by Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang signed this GPU being auctioned for charity at Micro Center.\n“I joke that whoever wins the bid should get a Jensen leather jacket as well,” said Ackerman.\nAnd this Micro Center store has a good location (5201 Stevens Creek Boulevard in Santa Clara) that is just a six-minute drive from Apple’s worldwide headquarters and (perhaps better yet) a one-minute walk from the Korean Hair Salon.\nMicro Center had a previous store in Silicon Valley, near Intel’s headquarters in Santa Clara. But that store close in 2012 because the company couldn’t negotiate better terms with the landlord. For its return to the Bay Area, Micro Center bided its time and came back at a time when many other retail chains were failing. It proves that the once proud region — the birthplace of electronics — still merits its own electronics store.\nYou can buy dyes for liquid-cooled tubes at Micro Center.\nSure, we have Target, Best Buy and Walmart selling lots of electronics gear. But there’s nothing like the Akihabara electronics district in Japan, which is full of multi-story electronics stores and gaming arcades.\nBut this store is loaded with today’s modern top gear, like AI PCs, Ubiquity home networking gear, and dyes for multi-colored water-cooling systems. Vendors like Razer and Logitech had their own sections. Ackerman was pleased to show me the USB-C to USB-A adapter in stock, among many obscure items. And he showed me the inventory machine that could rotate its stock of 3D-printing filaments and give you the exact SKU that you scanned with a bar code.\nTech hobbyists can find their love at Micro Center.\n“That’s super fun. I call it Mr. Filaments,” Ackerman said of the inventory robot.\nThere’s a section for hobbyists who like single-board computing and DIY projects. There’s a set of video, audio and digital content creation tools for content creators. All told, there are more than 20,000 products and over 100 tech experts who can help. It even has the numbered cashier locations where you can check out — the same kind of checkout stands that Fry’s had.\nThe Mr. Filaments robot inventory system at Micro Center.\nCustomers can receive authorized computer service for brands like Apple, Dell, and HP, benefiting from same-day diagnostics and repairs, thanks to over 3,000 parts on hand through partnerships with leading OEMs. I only wish it had a help desk for Comcast.\nMicro Center has gear to entertain geeks.\nMicro Center started in 1979 in Columbus, Ohio. It’s a surprise there aren’t more nerd stores, given how ubiquitous tech is around the world these days.\nBut Ackerman said, “These guys are really doing it right, picking and choosing, finding the right cities, finding the right locations. That’s why Charlotte is great. Miami is a big tech hub, especially for health tech. And we’re literally five minutes away from Apple headquarters and plenty of other places. People from HP and Nvidia and other companies are coming in today to hang out.”\n“Even though this store is big, the CEO (Richard Mershad) is really into curation, making sure it’s the right mix of stuff. He’s making sure it doesn’t go too far afield. So you’re not going to come in here and find, you know, hair dryers or lawncare equipment,” Ackerman said. “You’re going to find computer and home entertainment stuff, and DIY gear. There are components, just like in a Radio Shack, that hobbyists care about.”\nDan Ackerman knows how to install a TV on your wall.\nAs for the Micro Center News, Ackerman told me he has around 10 regular contributors and 20 more freelancers writing gadget reviews and other stories about tech gear. It is a kind of refuge for that vanishing breed of professional tech journalists.

This development could unlock a new wave of enterprise applications that require models to understand and draw insights from extensive documents such as detailed corporate filings, lengthy financial statements, or complex legal contracts.\nThe challenge of long-form reasoning for AI\nRecent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs), particularly through\nreinforcement learning\n(RL), have significantly improved their problem-solving capabilities. Research shows that when trained with RL fine-tuning, LRMs acquire skills similar to human “\nslow thinking\n,” where they develop sophisticated strategies to tackle complex tasks.\nHowever, these improvements are primarily seen when models work with relatively short pieces of text, typically around 4,000 tokens. The ability of these models to scale their reasoning to much longer contexts (e.g., 120,000 tokens) remains a major challenge. Such long-form reasoning requires a robust understanding of the entire context and the ability to perform multi-step analysis. “This limitation poses a significant barrier to practical applications requiring interaction with external knowledge, such as deep research, where LRMs must collect and process information from knowledge-intensive environments,” the developers of QwenLong-L1 write in their\npaper\n.\nThe researchers formalize these challenges into the concept of “long-context reasoning RL.” Unlike short-context reasoning, which often relies on knowledge already stored within the model, long-context reasoning RL requires models to retrieve and ground relevant information from lengthy inputs accurately. Only then can they generate chains of reasoning based on this incorporated information.\nTraining models for this through RL is tricky and often results in inefficient learning and unstable optimization processes. Models struggle to converge on good solutions or lose their ability to explore diverse reasoning paths.\nQwenLong-L1: A multi-stage approach\nQwenLong-L1 is a reinforcement learning framework designed to help LRMs transition from proficiency with short texts to robust generalization across long contexts. The framework enhances existing short-context LRMs through a carefully structured, multi-stage process:\nWarm-up Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):\nThe model first undergoes an SFT phase, where it is trained on examples of long-context reasoning. This stage establishes a solid foundation, enabling the model to ground information accurately from long inputs. It helps develop fundamental capabilities in understanding context, generating logical reasoning chains, and extracting answers.\nCurriculum-Guided Phased RL:\nAt this stage, the model is trained through multiple phases, with the target length of the input documents gradually increasing. This systematic, step-by-step approach helps the model stably adapt its reasoning strategies from shorter to progressively longer contexts. It avoids the instability often seen when models are abruptly trained on very long texts.\nDifficulty-Aware Retrospective Sampling:\nThe final training stage incorporates challenging examples from the preceding training phases, ensuring the model continues to learn from the hardest problems. This prioritizes difficult instances and encourages the model to explore more diverse and complex reasoning paths.\nQwenLong-L1 process Source: arXiv\nBeyond this structured training, QwenLong-L1 also uses a distinct reward system. While training for short-context reasoning tasks often relies on strict rule-based rewards (e.g., a correct answer in a math problem), QwenLong-L1 employs a hybrid reward mechanism. This combines rule-based verification, which ensures precision by checking for strict adherence to correctness criteria, with an “\nLLM-as-a-judge\n.” This judge model compares the semanticity of the generated answer with the ground truth, allowing for more flexibility and better handling of the diverse ways correct answers can be expressed when dealing with long, nuanced documents.\nPutting QwenLong-L1 to the test\nThe Alibaba team evaluated QwenLong-L1 using document question-answering (DocQA) as the primary task. This scenario is highly relevant to enterprise needs, where AI must understand dense documents to answer complex questions.\nExperimental results across seven long-context DocQA benchmarks showed QwenLong-L1’s capabilities. Notably, the QWENLONG-L1-32B model (based on\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B\n) achieved performance comparable to Anthropic’s\nClaude-3.7 Sonnet Thinking\n, and outperformed models like OpenAI’s\no3-mini\nand Qwen3-235B-A22B. The smaller QWENLONG-L1-14B model also outperformed Google’s\nGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking\nand Qwen3-32B.\nSource: arXiv\nAn important finding relevant to real-world applications is how RL training results in the model developing specialized long-context reasoning behaviors. The paper notes that models trained with QwenLong-L1 become better at “grounding” (linking answers to specific parts of a document), “subgoal setting” (breaking down complex questions), “backtracking” (recognizing and correcting their own mistakes mid-reasoning), and “verification” (double-checking their answers).\nFor instance, while a base model might get sidetracked by irrelevant details in a financial document or get stuck in a loop of over-analyzing unrelated information, the QwenLong-L1 trained model demonstrated an ability to engage in effective self-reflection. It could successfully filter out these distractor details, backtrack from incorrect paths, and arrive at the correct answer.\nTechniques like QwenLong-L1 could significantly expand the utility of AI in the enterprise. Potential applications include legal tech (analyzing thousands of pages of legal documents), finance (deep research on annual reports and financial filings for risk assessment or investment opportunities) and customer service (analyzing long customer interaction histories to provide more informed support). The researchers have released the\ncode for the QwenLong-L1 recipe\nand the\nweights for the trained models\n.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
