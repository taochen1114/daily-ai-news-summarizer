Could someone be watching a video about the Maldives and direct their AI agent to start finding flights and hotels, and book these seamlessly?\nWe‘re inching closer to a similar future as the travel industry begins to embrace agentic AI.\nKayak\nand\nExpedia\n, two of the largest companies in travel booking, said during\nVB Transform\nthat personalization and changing search patterns mean travel companies can rely on agents to make travel inspiration a reality.\nMatthias Keller, chief product officer at Kayak, said the company has been\nexperimenting\nwith this idea for a couple of years, even taking advantage of a partnership with\nAmazon’s Alexa\n. Kayak no longer launches on Alexa, but that hasn’t stopped the company from offering different search modes for customers.\n“We are striving for this vision of a travel agent that is always available, that is agentic and powered by AI,” Keller said onstage at VB Transform. “In April, we launched our new testbed for agentic travel booking called\nKayak AI\n; it’s a fully chat-based agentic experience that puts together the power of ChatGPT and many different tools. One is web search, but we also offer tools specifically for flights or hotels.”\nKeller said Kayak is “working towards our vision of having this fully personalized experienced that does all the heavy lifting for you when you plan travel.”\nWhile the idea of an agent proactively guiding potential travelers makes for efficient trip planning, Expedia CTO Ramana Thumu noted that there is a delicate balance to strike.\n“More and more customer expectations will revolve around a seamless experience, from search to completing transactions,” Thumu said. “But the most important thing, and the shift I see happening, is asking for the balance between the control the traveler has, and the control we give to the agent.”\nFrom social media feeds to reality\nOne reason this balance becomes essential is that, increasingly, consumers find travel inspiration everywhere. For\none of its AI projects\n, Expedia decided to capitalize on the growing influence of travel influencers who post their trips on Instagram.\nThumu said Expedia’s\nTrip Matching feature\n, which launched in June for U.S. customers, allows people to send any travel-related public Instagram Reel to Expedia, and the platform can build an itinerary based on them.\nThumu said Expedia can build this type of AI product because of its extensive database amassed over 30 years. Both Thumu and Keller underscored the importance of data in building out these personalizations, a task that can be challenging.\nPersonalization can go beyond planning a trip based on inspiration or previous preferences, as Keller said; eventually, their platforms and AI agents can also start recommending things to do based on the weather in your planned location during your stay.\nAI helps simplify the complexity\nOne use case where companies like Kayak and Expedia find AI to be helpful is for “snackers,” or individuals who search for flights or hotels without any intention of booking. These are usually people who just want to check the price of a flight or find out how much a hotel costs.\nAI systems can help snackers find their answers, and may even encourage them to go on that trip, because much of the tediousness of finding accommodation, transportation and activities can be presented to them right there on either the Expedia or Kayak front end.\n“What I find interesting when I pitch Kayak AI to somebody [is] I can say that we can get this complex trip planned without running all of the searches,” Keller said. “Every hotel booking site out there can tell you that a hotel has a pool, but you have to go deep to find an infinity pool. That’s the type of question that ChatGPT does a great job with, so it’s something we have to adapt and deliver.”\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nScott White still marvels at how quickly artificial intelligence has transformed from a novelty into a true work partner. Just over a year ago, the product lead for\nClaude AI\nat\nAnthropic\nwatched as early AI coding tools could barely complete a single line of code. Today, he’s building production-ready software features himself — despite not being a professional programmer.\n“I no longer think about my job as writing a PRD and trying to convince someone to do something,” White said during a fireside chat at\nVB Transform 2025\n, VentureBeat’s annual enterprise AI summit in San Francisco. “The first thing I do is, can I build a workable prototype of this on our staging server and then share a demo of it actually working.”\nThis shift represents a broader transformation in how enterprises are adopting AI, moving beyond simple chatbots that answer questions to sophisticated “agentic” systems capable of autonomous work. White’s experience offers a glimpse into what may be coming for millions of other knowledge workers.\nFrom code completion to autonomous programming: AI’s breakneck evolution\nThe evolution has been remarkably swift. When White joined Anthropic, the company’s\nClaude 2\nmodel could handle basic text completion. The release of\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\nenabled the creation of entire applications, leading to features like\nArtifacts\nthat let users generate custom interfaces. Now, with\nClaude 4\nachieving a 72.5% score on the\nSWE-bench coding benchmark\n, the model can function as what White calls “a fully remote agentic software engineer.”\nClaude Code\n, the company’s latest coding tool, can analyze entire codebases, search the internet for API documentation, issue pull requests, respond to code review comments, and iterate on solutions — all while working asynchronously for hours. White noted that 90% of Claude Code itself was written by the AI system.\n“That is like an entire agentic process in the background that was not possible six months ago,” White explained.\nEnterprise giants slash work time from weeks to minutes with AI agents\nThe implications extend far beyond software development.\nNovo Nordisk\n, the Danish pharmaceutical giant, has integrated Claude into workflows that previously took 10 weeks to complete clinical reports, now finishing the same work in 10 minutes.\nGitLab\nuses the technology for everything from sales proposals to technical documentation. Intuit deploys Claude to provide tax advice directly to consumers.\nWhite distinguishes between different levels of AI integration: simple language models that answer questions, models enhanced with tools like web search, structured workflows that incorporate AI into business processes, and full agents that can pursue goals autonomously using multiple tools and iterative reasoning.\n“I think about an agent as something that has a goal, and then it can just do many things to accomplish that goal,” White said. The key enabler has been what he calls the “inexorable” relationship between model intelligence and new product capabilities.\nThe infrastructure revolution: Building networks of AI collaborators\nA critical infrastructure development has been\nAnthropic’s Model Context Protocol\n(MCP), which White describes as “the USB-C for integrations.” Rather than companies building separate connections to each data source or tool, MCP provides a standardized way for AI systems to access enterprise software, from Salesforce to internal knowledge repositories.\n“It’s really democratizing access to data,” White said, noting that integrations built by one company can be shared and reused by others through the open-source protocol.\nFor organizations looking to implement AI agents, White recommends starting small and building incrementally. “Don’t try to build an entire agentic system from scratch,” he advised. “Build the component of it, make sure that component works, then build a next component.”\nHe also emphasized the importance of evaluation systems to ensure AI agents perform as intended. “Evals are the new PRD,” White said, referring to product requirement documents, highlighting how companies must develop new methods to assess AI performance on specific business tasks.\nFrom AI assistants to AI organizations: The next workforce frontier\nLooking ahead, White envisions AI development becoming accessible to non-technical workers, similar to how coding capabilities have advanced. He imagines a future where individuals manage not just one AI agent but entire organizations of specialized AI systems.\n“How can everyone be their own mini CPO or CEO?” White asked. “I don’t exactly know what that looks like, but that’s the kind of thing that I wake up and want to get there.”\nThe transformation White describes reflects broader industry trends as companies grapple with AI’s expanding capabilities. While early adoption focused on experimental use cases, enterprises are increasingly integrating AI into core business processes, fundamentally changing how work gets done.\nAs AI agents become more autonomous and capable, the challenge shifts from teaching machines to perform tasks to managing AI collaborators that can work independently for extended periods. For White, this future is already arriving — one production feature at a time.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
