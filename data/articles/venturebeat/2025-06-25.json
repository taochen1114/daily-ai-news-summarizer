VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nWhat would it be like to chat with health records the way one could with ChatGPT?\nInitially posed by a medical student, this question sparked the development of ChatEHR at\nStanford Health Care\n. Now in production, the tool accelerates chart reviews for emergency room admissions, streamlines patient transfer summaries and synthesizes information from complex medical histories.\nIn early pilot results, clinical users have experienced significantly sped-up information retrieval; notably, emergency physicians saw 40% reduced chart review time during critical handoffs, Michael A. Pfeffer, Stanford’s SVP and chief information and digital officer, said today in a fireside chat at\nVB Transform\n.\nThis helps to decrease physician burnout while improving\npatient care\n, and builds upon decades of work medical facilities have been doing to collect and automate critical data.\n“It’s such an exciting time in healthcare because we’ve been spending the last 20 years digitizing healthcare data and putting it into an electronic health record, but not really transforming it,” Pfeffer said in a chat with VB editor-in-chief Matt Marshall. “With the new large language model technologies, we’re actually starting to do that digital transformation.”\nHow ChatEHR helps reduce ‘pajama time,’ get back to real face-to-face interactions\nPhysicians spend up to 60% of their time on administrative tasks rather than direct patient care\n. They often put in significant “\npajama time\n,” sacrificing\npersonal and family hours to complete administrative tasks outside of regular work hours.\nOne of Pfeffer’s big goals is to streamline workflows and reduce those extra hours so clinicians and administrative staff can focus on more important work.\nFor example, a lot of information comes in through online patient portals. AI now has the ability to read messages from patients and draft responses that a human can then review and approve for sending.\n“It’s kind of like a starting point,” he explained. “While it doesn’t necessarily save time, which is interesting, it does actually reduce cognitive burnout.” What’s more, he noted, the messages tend to be more patient friendly, because users can instruct the model to use certain language.\nMoving on to agents, Pfeffer said they’re a “pretty new” concept in healthcare but offer promising opportunities.\nFor instance, patients with cancer diagnoses typically have a team of specialists who review their records and determine the next treatment steps. However, preparing is a lot of work; clinicians and staff have to go through a patient’s entire record, not just their EHR but imaging pathology, sometimes genomic data, and information on clinical trials that patients might be a good match for. All of these have to come together for the team to create a timeline and recommendations, Pfeffer explained.\n“The most important thing that we can do for our patients is to make sure they have appropriate care, and it takes a multidisciplinary approach,” said Pfeffer.\nThe goal is to build agents into ChatEHR that can generate a summary and timeline and make recommendations for clinician review. Pfeffer emphasized that it doesn’t replace, it prepares “just incredible summary recommendations in a multimodal way.”\nThis allows medical teams to do now “actual patient care,” which is critical amidst a physician and nursing shortage.\n“These technologies are going to shift the time physicians and nurses spend doing administrative tasks,” he said. And, when combined with\nambient AI scribes\nthat take over notetaking duties, medical staff are focusing more time on patients.\n“That face-to-face interaction is just priceless,” said Pfeffer. “We’re going to see AI shift more to clinician-patient interaction.”\n‘Amazing’ technologies coupled with a multidisciplinary team\nBefore ChatEHR, Pfeffer’s team rolled out SecureGPT to all of Stanford Medicine; the secure portal features 15 different models that anyone can tinker with. “What is really powerful about this technology is that you can really open it up to so many people to experiment,” said Pfeffer.\nStanford is taking a varied approach to AI development, building its own models and using a mix of secure and private off-the-shelf (such as Microsoft Azure) and open-source models where appropriate. Pfeffer explained that his team is “not completely specific” to one or the other, but rather goes with what will likely work best for a specific use case.\n“There’s so many amazing kinds of technologies now that if you can piece them together in the right way, you can get solutions like what we’ve built,” he said.\nAnother credit to Stanford is its multidisciplinary team; as opposed to a chief AI officer or AI group, Pfeffer gathered a chief data scientist, two informaticists, a chief medical information officer and a chief nursing information officer, and their CTO and CISO.\n“We bring together informatics, data science and traditional IT, and wrap that into the architecture; what you get is this magic group that allows you to do these very complex projects,” he said.\nUltimately, Stanford views AI as a tool that everybody should know how to use, Pfeffer emphasized. Different teams need to understand how to use AI so that when they meet with business owners and come up with ways to solve problems, “AI is just part of how they think.”\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nVibe coding has been all the rage in recent months as a simple way for anyone to build applications with generative AI.\nBut what if that same easy-going, natural language approach was extended to other enterprise workflows? That’s the promise of an emerging category of agentic AI applications. At\nVB Transform 2025\ntoday, one such application was on display with the\nGenspark Super Agent,\nwhich was originally launched earlier this year.\nThe Genspark Super Agent’s promise and approach could well extend the concept of vibe coding into vibe working. A key tenet of enabling vibe working, though, is to go with the flow and exert less control rather than more over AI agents.\n“The vision is simple, we want to bring the Cursor experience for developers to the workspace for everyone,” Kay Zhu, CTO of\nGenspark\n, said at VB Transform. “Everyone here should be able to do vibe working… it’s not only the software engineer that can do vibe coding.”\n>>\nSee all our Transform 2025 coverage here\n<<\nLess is more when it comes to enterprise agentic AI\nAccording to Zhu, a foundational premise for enabling a vibe working era is letting go of some rigid rules that have defined enterprise workflows for generations.\nZhu provocatively challenged enterprise AI orthodoxy, arguing that rigid workflows fundamentally limit what AI agents can accomplish for complex business tasks. During a live demonstration, he showed the system autonomously researching conference speakers, creating presentations, making phone calls and analyzing marketing data.\nMost notably, the system placed an actual phone call to the event organizer, VentureBeat founder Matt Marshall, during the live presentation.\n“This is normally the call that I don’t really want to do by myself, you know, in person. So I let the agent do it,” Zhu explained as the audience listened to his AI agent attempt to convince the moderator to move his presentation slot before\nAndrew Ng’s session\n. The call connected in real-time, with the agent autonomously crafting persuasive arguments on Zhu’s behalf.\nThe calling feature has revealed unexpected use cases highlighting both the platform’s capabilities and users’ comfort with AI autonomy.\n“We actually observe a lot of people are using Genspark to call… to do different kinds of things,” Zhu noted. “Some of the Japanese users are using this to call to resign from their company. You know they don’t like the company, but they don’t want to call them again. and some of the people are using call for me agents to break up with their boyfriend and girlfriend.”\nThese real-world applications demonstrate how users are pushing AI agents beyond traditional business workflows into deeply personal territory.\nTechnical architecture: Why backtracking is good for enterprise AI\nThe system accomplishes all of that without predefined workflows. The platform’s core philosophy of ‘less control, more tools’ represents a fundamental departure from traditional enterprise AI approaches.\n“Workflow in our definition is the predefined steps and these kinds of steps often break on edge cases, when the user asks harder and harder questions, the workflow cannot hold,” Zhu said.\nGenspark’s agentic engine represents a significant departure from traditional workflow-based AI systems.\nThe platform combines nine different large language models (LLMs) in a mixture-of-experts (MoE) configuration, equipped with over 80 tools and 10+ premium datasets. The system operates on a classic agent loop: plan, execute, observe and backtrack. Zhu emphasized that the power actually lives in the backtrack stage.\nThis backtracking capability allows the agent to intelligently recover from failures and find alternative approaches when unexpected situations arise, rather than failing at predefined workflow boundaries. The system uses LLM judges to evaluate every agent session and attributes rewards to each step, feeding this data back through reinforcement learning and prompt playbooks for continuous improvement.\nThe technical approach differs markedly from established frameworks like\nLangChain\nor\nCrewAI\n, which typically require more structured workflow definition. While these platforms excel at orchestrating predictable multi-step processes, Genspark’s architecture prioritizes autonomous problem-solving over deterministic execution paths.\nEnterprise Strategy: Workflows today, vibe working agents tomorrow\nGenspark’s rapid scaling, from launch to $36 million ARR in 45 days, demonstrates that autonomous agent platforms are moving beyond experimental phases into commercial viability.\nThe company’s ‘less control, more tools’ philosophy challenges fundamental assumptions about enterprise AI architecture.\nThe implications for enterprises leading in AI adoption are clear: start architecting systems that can handle predictable workflows and autonomous problem-solving. The key is designing platforms that gracefully escalate from deterministic processes to agentic behavior when complexity demands it.\nFor enterprises planning later AI adoption, Genspark’s success signals that vibe working is becoming a competitive differentiator. Organizations that remain locked into rigid workflow thinking may be disadvantaged as AI-native companies embrace more fluid, adaptive approaches to knowledge work.\nThe question isn’t whether autonomous AI agents will reshape enterprise workflows—it’s whether your organization will be ready when the 20% of complex cases becomes 80% of your AI workload.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nAs AI-powered tools spread through enterprise software stacks, the rapid growth of the AI coding platform\nWindsurf\nis becoming a case study of what happens when developers adopt agentic tooling at scale.\nIn a session at today’s\nVB Transform 2025 conference\n,\nCEO and co-founder Varun Mohan\ndiscussed how Windsurf’s integrated development environment (IDE) surpassed one million developers within four months of launch. More notably, the platform now writes over half of the code committed by its user base.\nThe conversation, moderated by VentureBeat CEO Matt Marshall, opened with a brief but pointed disclaimer: Mohan could not comment on OpenAI’s widely reported potential acquisition of Windsurf.\nThe issue has\ndrawn attention following a\nWall Street Journal\nreport\ndetailing a brewing standoff between OpenAI and Microsoft over the terms of that deal and broader tensions within their multi-billion-dollar partnership. According to the\nWSJ\n, OpenAI seeks to acquire Windsurf without giving Microsoft access to its intellectual property— an issue that could reshape the enterprise AI coding landscape.\nWith that context set aside, the session focused on Windsurf’s technology, enterprise traction, and vision for agentic development.\n>>\nSee all our Transform 2025 coverage here\n<<\nMoving past autocomplete\nWindsurf’s IDE is built around what the company calls a “mind-meld” loop—a shared project state between humans and AI that enables full coding flows rather than autocomplete suggestions. With this setup, agents can perform multi-file refactors, write test suites, and even launch UI changes when a pull request is initiated.\nMohan emphasized that coding assistance can’t stop at code generation. “Only about 20 to 30% of a developer’s time is spent writing code. The rest is debugging, reviewing, and testing. To truly assist, an AI system needs access to all those data sources,” he explained.\nWindsurf recently embedded a browser inside its IDE, allowing agents to test changes, read logs, and interact with live interfaces directly—much like a human engineer would.\nSecurity and control by design\nAs AI begins to participate in enterprise development cycles actively, Windsurf’s emphasis on built-in security has proven essential. “We use a hybrid model for enterprise deployments—none of the personalized data is stored outside the user’s tenant. Security is core, especially with features like our integrated browser agent,” said Mohan.\nThese capabilities have already made Windsurf a viable option for regulated industries. Its agents are deployed on massive codebases, including those at JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.\nMohan added that as AI becomes more accessible across roles, security will become a gating factor for productivity. “If everyone at a company will contribute to technology in some way, the missing piece is security. You don’t want a one-off system built by a non-technical user destroying another service,” he said.\nSmall teams, rapid testing\nInternally, Windsurf organizes into lean squads of three or four engineers, each focused on testing a narrow set of product hypotheses.\n“There’s a belief that one-person billion-dollar companies are the future. But in reality, more people allow you to grow faster and build better products. The key is organizing into small, focused teams that test hypotheses in parallel,” Mohan explained.\nThis model has helped the company iterate quickly in a space where foundational AI models—and user needs—evolve at breakneck speed.\nPersonalization at scale\nWindsurf’s biggest optimization at enterprise scale isn’t faster token generation or smaller models—it’s relevance. “At scale, the biggest optimization is personalization. Deeply understanding the codebase allows the agent to make maintainable, large-scale changes that reflect user intent,” said Mohan.\nRather than relying solely on general-purpose code generation, Windsurf’s system learns each customer’s stack’s structure, style, and preferences.\nBuilding for future models\nLooking forward, Windsurf is designing its platform to remain adaptable as the capabilities of underlying AI models continue to grow.\n“Every step-function improvement in foundation models demands a major product rethink. As agents become more capable, our job is to build the platform to manage and orchestrate many of them effectively,” Mohan said.\nThe company is working on an open protocol that will allow enterprises to integrate any LLM—including on-premises models—into Windsurf’s agent framework, preserving flexibility and minimizing vendor lock-in.\nProving and measuring value\nWindsurf provides transparency into its performance with built-in analytics. “We provide transparency on ROI through metrics—like the percentage of code written by the assistant—which can be tied directly to internal engineering performance,” Mohan said.\nThis approach allows platform teams to connect agentic productivity with business impact, helping justify further investment.\nFocused execution over flash\nFinally, when asked how Windsurf plans to differentiate itself amid competition from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and others, Mohan focused on internal velocity. “The challenge isn’t who’s more visible today, but who’s executing the right strategy fast enough. The risk is either moving too slowly or projecting too far out and missing near-term relevance,” he said.\nMohan also dismissed the idea that incumbents are inevitably doomed. “There’s no fundamental reason legacy companies like Salesforce can’t become AI-native. The real limiter is their speed of innovation, not their capability.”\nWhether Windsurf becomes part of OpenAI’s future or continues independently, the company’s traction with enterprise customers — and its insistence on grounding AI in secure, measurable workflows — makes it a player worth watching as agentic development enters the mainstream.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
