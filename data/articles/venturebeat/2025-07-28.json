One executive coach eventually responded that he found AI to be an\nexcellent thought partner\nwhen working with clients. Another coach suggested that it would be helpful to be familiar with the Chinese Room analogy, arguing that no matter how sophisticated a machine becomes, it cannot understand or coach the way humans do. And that was it. The conversation moved on.\nThe Chinese Room is a philosophical thought experiment\ndevised by John Searle\nin 1980 to challenge the idea that a machine can truly “understand” or possess consciousness simply because it behaves as if it does. Today’s leading chatbots are almost certainly not conscious in the way that humans are, but they often behave as if they are. By citing the experiment in this context, the coach was dismissing the value of these chatbots, suggesting that they could not perform or even assist in useful executive coaching.\nIt was a small moment, but the story seemed poignant. Why did the discussion stall? What lay beneath the surface of that philosophical objection? Was it discomfort, skepticism or something more foundational?\nA few days later, I spoke with a healthcare administrator and conference organizer. She noted that, while her large hospital chain had enterprise access to Gemini, many staff had yet to explore its capabilities. As I described how AI is already transforming healthcare workflows, from documentation to diagnostics, it became clear that much of this was still unfamiliar.\nThe AI Impact Series Returns to San Francisco - August 5\nThe next phase of AI is here - are you ready? Join leaders from Block, GSK, and SAP for an exclusive look at how autonomous agents are reshaping enterprise workflows - from real-time decision-making to end-to-end automation.\nSecure your spot now - space is limited:\nhttps://bit.ly/3GuuPLF\nThese are just anecdotes, yes, but they point to a deeper pattern redrawing the landscape of professional value. As in previous technological shifts, the early movers are not just crossing a threshold, they are defining it. This may sound familiar. In many ways, AI is following the arc of past technological revolutions: A small set of early adopters, a larger wave of pragmatic followers, a hesitant remainder. Just as with electricity, the internet, or mobile computing, value tends to concentrate early, and pressure to conform builds.\nBut this migration is different in at least three important ways. First, AI does not just automate tasks. Instead, it begins to appropriate judgment, language and creative expression, blurring the line between what machines do and what humans are for. Second, adoption is outpacing understanding. People are using AI daily while still questioning whether they trust it, believe in it or even comprehend what it is doing. Thirdly, AI does not just change what we do; it reshapes how we see. Personalized responses and generative tools\nalter the very fabric of shared reality\n, fragmenting the cognitive commons that previous technologies largely left intact.\nWe are in the early stages of what I have described as a great\ncognitive migration\n, a slow but profound shift away from traditional domains of human expertise and toward new terrain where intelligence is increasingly ambient, machine-augmented and organizationally centralized. But not everyone is migrating at the same pace. Not everyone is eager to go. Some hesitate. Some resist.\nThis is not simply a matter of risk aversion or fear of change. For many professionals, especially those in fields like coaching, education, healthcare administration or communications, contribution is rooted in attentiveness, discretion and human connection. The value does not easily translate into metrics of speed or scale.\nYet AI tools often arrive wrapped in metaphors of orchestration and optimization, shaped by engineering logic and computational efficiency. In work defined by relational insight or contextual judgment, these metaphors can feel alien or even diminishing. If you do not see your value reflected in the tools, why would you rush to embrace them?\nSo, we should ask: What happens if this migration accelerates and sizable portions of the workforce are slow to move? Not because they cannot, but because they do not view the destination — the use of AI — as inviting. Or because this destination does not yet feel like home.\nHistory offers a metaphor. In the biblical story of Exodus, not everyone was eager to leave Egypt. Some questioned the journey. Others longed for the predictability of what they knew, even as they admitted its costs. Migration is rarely just a matter of geography or progress. It is also about identity, trust and what is at stake in leaving something known for something unclear.\nCognitive migration is no different. If we treat it purely as a technical or economic challenge, we risk missing its human contours. Some will move quickly. Others will wait. Still others will ask if the new land honors what they hold most dear. Nevertheless, this migration has already begun. And while we might hope to design a path that honors diverse ways of knowing and working, the terrain is already being shaped by those who move fastest.\nPathways of cognitive migration\nThe journey is not the same for everyone.\nSome people have already embraced AI, drawn by its promise, energized by its potential or aligned with its accelerating relevance. Others are moving more hesitantly, adapting because the landscape demands it, not because they sought it. Still others are resisting, not necessarily out of ignorance but fear, uncertainty, or conviction, and are protecting values they do not yet see reflected in the tools. A fourth group remains outside the migration path, not because they overtly object to it, but because their work has not yet been touched by it. And finally, some are disconnected more fundamentally, already at the margins of the digital economy, lacking access, education or the opportunity to participate.\nThese are not just attitudes. They are positions on a shifting map. They reveal who migrates by choice or pressure, who resists on principle and who might never join.\nThe willing\nSome people have not hesitated. Like early gold miners heading for California, they have embraced AI out of curiosity, enthusiasm or a sense that it aligns naturally with their outlook. These are the willing migrants, those comfortable at or near the frontier: Consultants using language models to refine client proposals, developers accelerating their coding process, storytellers using AI-generated video. Some are exploring AI as a creative partner, others as a tactical advantage. For this group, the terrain feels not just navigable, but exciting.\nBut even within this group, motivations differ. Some see how AI can amplify their own productivity or extend their reach. Others are drawn to the novelty and enjoy playing with the tools. Many are experimenting in a relatively unstructured environment, learning what AI can do before it is formally required or widely governed. To them, this is still the wild west. And what they adopt, refine or normalize will shape the cognitive landscape the rest of us enter.\nTheir enthusiasm is valuable. It pushes cognitive migration forward and carries quiet power: Even if they do not know it, they are setting the terms for how value, fluency and legitimacy are being redefined.\nThe pressured\nFor many, migration is not optional; it is expected. These are the pressured migrants: Those adapting because their organization, industry or clients demand it. AI is now embedded in areas like project management, customer service and marketing workflows, making fluency less of a differentiator and more of a baseline requirement.\nYet, formal support is often lacking. A 2025 global\nKPMG–University of Melbourne study\nfound that 58% of employees intentionally use AI at work, with a third doing so weekly or daily. However, a\nMcKinsey survey\nfound a fifth of employees had received minimal to no support from their companies, and nearly half want more formal training. For example, a marketing manager is now expected to generate first drafts with AI, even though no one has shown her how to prompt effectively.\nThese migrants navigate a tenuous middle ground. Some are cautiously optimistic, seeing AI as essential for staying relevant. Others are anxious, sensing that falling behind could mean irrelevance or redundancy. If the “willing migrants” are blazing the trail, the pressured are following close behind. They often do so warily, with little bandwidth to question the terrain, but a clear awareness that stopping is not an option.\nThe resistant\nSome have chosen not to migrate, at least not yet, and perhaps not at all. These are the resistant migrants: Those who hesitate out of fear, uncertainty or conviction. Many perform roles grounded in presence, empathy, discretion or ethics. They may be therapists, teachers, writers, chaplains or coaches. For them, the premise of cognitive outsourcing raises not just technical questions, but existential ones.\nThis group often sees AI tools as misaligned with the deeper value they offer. In their view, tools may simplify what should be nuanced or automate what requires trust and human connection. They might worry that using AI to draft a letter, summarize a meeting or respond to a client flattens nuance, dilutes trust or undermines relationships built over time. A longtime therapist could plausibly suspect that AI-generated notes miss the emotional texture of a session.\nTheir resistance is not a refusal to evolve. It is, in many cases, a defense of meaning, judgment and humans themselves. This echoes a theme in Jen Gish’s “\nThe Resisters\n”: A quiet defiance, not of technology itself, but of the belief that everything worth doing can be done by a machine.\nThe unreached\nAnother group of people are not migrating, at least not yet. These are the unreached migrants: Workers whose roles have not been meaningfully affected by AI. They include tradespeople, farm workers, bus drivers and line cooks. These are people whose daily work is physical, place-based and shaped more by coordination or skill than purely by cognition. They may have considerable domain knowledge, but they are not broadly considered knowledge workers. For them, AI may appear in the headlines or workplace chatter, but it has little relevance to their routines.\nTheir distance from this migration is not about resistance or lack of interest. The cognitive landscape that AI is currently reshaping is not the one they occupy. The embodied AI tools are not yet available for what they do. The physical robots have not much invaded their workplace. Whether that remains true will depend on how AI evolves, and whether the physical and manual domains of work eventually become targets of transformation. For now, most of them are watching a journey that feels like it is happening somewhere else, to someone else.\nThe disconnected\nThen there are those for whom migration is not just irrelevant, but out of reach. These are the disconnected: Individuals who are already marginalized within the digital economy. They may lack access to technology, consistent connectivity, formal education or the support systems that make digital learning and adaptation possible. AI may be in the news or their communities, but it is not part of their world in a usable or trustworthy form.\nThis group is aware of change, but they are often left out of it. If this cognitive migration continues to define new norms of value, intelligence and legitimacy, they risk becoming a new underclass, not because they opted out, but because they were never truly included.\nThis migration, and others before it\nBefore we look at how this moment compares to past technology-driven shifts, it is worth acknowledging that the typology above is, by design, a simplification. People do not always migrate into clean categories. They move in and out of roles, contexts and stances. A plumber might use AI to write a children’s book after hours. Some may shift from enthusiastic to cautious depending on the context.\nYet even these broad strokes reveal something essential about how AI adoption is unfolding. And they offer a lens through which to revisit a familiar question: How does this migration compare to technological shifts we have seen before?\nWe have seen this pattern. The arrival of electricity, the internet and mobile computing each followed a similar arc. In every case, the tools began with promise, spread unevenly and gradually redrew the boundaries of work, skill and participation.\nThis migration also reflects a familiar tension between productivity and displacement. Just as machines replaced manual labor during the Industrial Revolution, AI is reshaping what it means to be useful, efficient or skilled in the cognitive domain. And as with other transitions, early benefits tend to concentrate among those with access, fluency and flexibility, while the risks fall more heavily on those slower to adapt.\nYet even as we recognize these familiar rhythms of technological change, three fundamental differences suggest this migration may unfold in ways that surprise us. It is not just changing how we work. It is redrawing the boundary between human and machine. Where earlier technologies extended physical power or accelerated communication, AI appropriates judgment, language and creativity. It does not just speed up cognition; it starts to perform it.\nWhat makes this shift more disorienting is the pace and the reach. AI is being integrated into everyday tools faster than governance or understanding can keep up. It is so tantalizing that many are using it before they fully trust it or even comprehend what it is doing. Adoption is outpacing orientation.\nPerhaps most consequentially, AI alters not just what we do, but how we see. Personalized outputs and generative interfaces are fragmenting the shared cognitive terrain that once underpinned professional and personal identity, institutional norms and cultural consensus. This is not merely a migration of function. It is a migration of meaning.\nThe road ahead\nCognitive migration is not just a change in tools. As multiple technology leaders have suggested, it may be as significant as the discovery of fire. It could lead to remarkable abundance, offering greater knowledge, improved financial circumstances and more creative outlets. But it could also result in a more dystopian outcome, marked by concentrated wealth, widespread unemployment and narrowed opportunity. In either case, this migration will reorder roles, values and entire professional classes.\nFor some, it may be a season of experimentation, adaptation and fulfillment. For others, it could be a forced migration, shaped less by choice than by economic necessity. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently\nwarned\nthat AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and drive unemployment to 10 to 20% within five years. This was amplified by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who said that certain job categories, such as customer support, would be\neliminated\nby AI. It is evident now that what AI can do is expanding faster than most institutions or individuals are prepared for.\nAnd it is not just entry-level work that may be affected. Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s incoming CEO for Applications, recently described AI as “the greatest source of empowerment for all.” In a widely shared\nessay\n, she praised her own business coach and noted that “personalized coaching has obviously been a privilege reserved for a few, but now with ChatGPT, it can be available to many.” What then becomes of the coach at the beginning of this article, a member of what we might now call the ‘resistant’ class?\nWe do not know how this migration will unfold. There will likely be no single moment when it is declared complete. But many may find themselves suddenly outside the borders of professional relevance, with little warning and fewer options. In the push for efficiency, competitive pressures rarely wait for consensus or lead to soft landings.\nInstitutions must quickly develop concrete responses, such as retraining programs that go beyond basic AI literacy, social safety nets that account for cognitive rather than just physical displacement, and new frameworks for measuring contribution that honor human qualities that AI cannot replicate. Otherwise, the fallout may be as psychologically dislocating as it is economically profound.\nThis is not a call for panic. It is a call for clarity.\nThe migration has already begun. The question is not whether it will reshape work, identity and opportunity, but how prepared we are to live with the shape it takes.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

It’s the Silicon Valley playbook: Make it great, make it cheap, get us addicted, then figure out how to make billions.\nWe love AI because it offers\ncognitive shortcuts\nat a whole new scale. But… this won’t end well for most of us. We’ll let AI take over a few tasks, and soon find it’s doing all of them. We’ll lose our minds, our jobs and our opportunities.\nBut it doesn’t have to happen this way. Here’s how to see the path ahead — and take a different one.\nThe beginning of the end\nIn March 2023, I used ChatGPT for the first time. Now I use\nChatGPT or Claude\nevery day. AI has made my brainwork faster and more productive. But I am also getting cognitively lazy.\nThe AI Impact Series Returns to San Francisco - August 5\nThe next phase of AI is here - are you ready? Join leaders from Block, GSK, and SAP for an exclusive look at how autonomous agents are reshaping enterprise workflows - from real-time decision-making to end-to-end automation.\nSecure your spot now - space is limited:\nhttps://bit.ly/3GuuPLF\nI used to have to check AI’s drafts thoroughly. But now, it gives me a good first draft 90% of the time, and I’m losing the motivation to check its work.\nA year ago, I thought the workforce would divide into “those who don’t use AI” and “those who do.” Now I see that’s wrong. In five years, everyone will use AI. The real divide will be between those who manage their AIs — and those who outsource their thinking to it.\nHow outsourcing degrades our thinking\nHumans have always offloaded cognitive work. Before books, bards memorized Homer’s entire Iliad. Now technology is an extension of our brains, enabling us to offload math, navigation and note-taking.\nAI is different. It can handle almost any cognitive task, and it feels productive. So\nAI outsourcing\nbegins innocently. You ask AI to draft an email. It does it well and saves you 10 minutes. Next, you ask it to outline a presentation. It nails it.\nYou start using it for more complex tasks, like setting strategy. You start depending on AI to do the work, and slowly, your skills atrophy.\nMicrosoft and Carnegie Mellon\nreleased a paper\nshowing gen AI can reduce our critical thinking ability. When knowledge workers are confident in AI’s output, they’re less likely to use their own brains.\nPeople who trust AI (like me) rely on themselves to be its fact-checker. But there are two problems with that: 1) We\noverestimate our ability\nto identify AI’s mistakes, and 2) The temptation to skip fact-checking gets stronger.\nAI drivers vs. passengers\nIn the next 10 years, the knowledge workforce will divide into two groups: AI drivers and AI passengers.\nAI passengers\nwill\nhappily delegate their cognitive work to AI. They’ll paste a prompt into ChatGPT, copy the result, and submit it as their own.\nShort term, they will be rewarded for doing faster work. But as AI operates with less human oversight, passengers will be judged as surplus for adding nothing to AI’s output.\nAI drivers\nwill insist on directing AI. They’ll use AI as a first draft and rigorously check its work. And they’ll turn it off sometimes and make time to think.\nLong term, the economic divide between these groups will widen dramatically. AI drivers will claim a disproportionate share of wealth, while passengers become replaceable.\nHow to be an AI driver\nMake yourself AI’s boss in these ways:\nStart with what you know.\nUse AI in areas where you have pre-existing expertise; be critical of its output.\nHave a conversation instead of asking for the answer.\nDon’t ask AI, “What should we do with our marketing budget?” Give AI constraints, inputs, options and debate with it.\nBe hyper-vigilant.\nBe an active participant. Don’t assume the output is good enough. Challenge yourself to ask, “\nIs\nthis a good recommendation?”\nPractice active skepticism.\nConstantly probe AI with your point of view. “Isn’t that downplaying the risk of this venture?”\nResist outsourcing every first draft.\nThe blank page is scary, but it’s crucial for activating your brain.\nMake the final call, and own it.\nAI should assist with every medium-to-high stakes decision you make, but it doesn’t make the final call. Own your decisions as a human.\nYour mind is a terrible thing to waste\nWith AI you now have a thought partner who’s available 24/7 and has “expertise” on any topic.\nBut you’re also at a crossroads. You’re going to see many colleagues opt out of “active thinking” and outsource their decision-making to AI. Many won’t even realize their cognitive skills have atrophied until it happens. And by then, it’ll be hard to go back.\nDon’t be this person. Use AI to challenge and strengthen your thinking, not replace it.\nThe question isn’t, “Will you use AI?” The question is, “What kind of AI user do you want to be: driver or passenger?”\nGreg Shove is the CEO of\nSection\n.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Looking forward to building asi [artificial superintelligence] and aligning it to empower people with the amazing team here. Let’s build!”\nZhao wrote in\nhis own Threads post\n.\n“Artificial superintelligence” is a nebulous term used in the AI industry to describe systems more powerful and capable than any today, beyond even the smartest humans, making them difficult to control.\nThe AI Impact Series Returns to San Francisco - August 5\nThe next phase of AI is here - are you ready? Join leaders from Block, GSK, and SAP for an exclusive look at how autonomous agents are reshaping enterprise workflows - from real-time decision-making to end-to-end automation.\nSecure your spot now - space is limited:\nhttps://bit.ly/3GuuPLF\nZhao’s strong commercial AI background\nZhao, who previously worked at OpenAI, played a key role in the development of foundational models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o, according to arXiv system cards and research papers listing him as a co-author. He’s also known for his academic work on generative models and fair representations, with widely cited papers in venues like NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR.\nZhao joins Meta amid a high-stakes hiring blitz across the AI industry. Over the past few months, Meta has poached researchers from OpenAI, Apple, Google, and Anthropic as part of a multibillion-dollar bet on superintelligence as\nCNN reported.\nMeta recently invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, acquiring a 49% stake and bringing on Wang to lead the superintelligence effort. Former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman also joined the team.\nThe company has reportedly offered compensation packages worth as much as\n$100 million to $300 million over four years\nto lure top AI talent, according to multiple reports. One claim from a rival AI startup founder alleged Meta offered\n$1.25 billion over four years\n—approximately\n$312 million per year\n—to a single candidate who declined.\nOther insiders say Meta’s most senior AI scientists may be receiving\n$10 million+ per year\n, while first-year comp for some new hires reportedly reached\n$100 million\n.\nAspirations of leading the AI frontier\nZuckerberg has made no secret of his ambition to make Meta a leader in AI’s next frontier, repeatedly stating that the company plans to “invest hundreds of billions of dollars into compute to build superintelligence” using its own business-generated capital.\nHe said the Llama 4 rollout underscored the importance of elite talent: “You can have hundreds of thousands of GPUs, but if you don’t have the right team developing the model, it doesn’t matter.”\nMeta’s fundamental AI research group (FAIR), still led by acclaimed scientist Yann LeCun, will remain separate from the new lab.\nThe creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs signals a more product- and mission-focused arm of Meta’s AI efforts, centered on building and aligning ASI with human interests.\nMaking up for the mixed reception of Llama 4\nHowever, Meta’s push into superintelligence has come on the heels of a bumpy rollout of its latest open-source foundation models.\nThe company released its\nLlama 4 model family in April 2025\n, positioning it as a leap forward in multimodal reasoning and long-context understanding. But the release has struggled to gain traction amid the rise of powerful Chinese open-source rivals like DeepSeek and Qwen.\nMeta faced public criticism\nfrom researchers and developers who cited poor real-world performance, confusion around benchmark results, and inconsistent quality across deployments.\nSome accused the company of “benchmark gamesmanship” and using unreleased optimized versions of Llama 4 to boost public perception—a claim Meta has denied.\nInternal sources blamed fast rollout timelines and bugs for the issues, but the episode has cast a shadow over Meta’s generative AI credibility just as it embarks on its most ambitious effort yet.\nJim Fan, a former Stanford colleague of Zhao and now Nvidia’s Director of Robotics and Distinguished Scientist,\noffered his endorsement on X\n: “Shengjia is one of the brightest, humblest, and most passionate scientists I know. Very bullish on MSL!”\nThe move underscores Meta’s strategy of spending aggressively now to secure a dominant position in what it views as the next foundational technology platform — one that could eclipse the mobile internet. As Zuckerberg sees it, ASI isn’t a moonshot — it’s the next frontier, and Meta intends to lead.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
